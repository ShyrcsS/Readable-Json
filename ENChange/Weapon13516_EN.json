The elder, having inherited the nightingale's emblem, took up the duty of guarding the sacred chariot.\r\nThe younger son, who had always admired his elder brother, had no choice but to forsake his family name and resign himself to a life of obscurity on the frontier.\r\nThen, a calamity, born of selfishness, shattered their ideals and changed their destiny forever...\r\nThe loyal guard was consumed by \"beasts,\" creature of pure darkness bereft of intellect, for the crime of glimpsing the secret of the philosophers.\r\nHis younger brother, who had left to quell distant unrest, returned to a world already covered in deep snow.\r\nBut instead of its customary silver-white feathers, the spear he found now wore the black stain of noble blood.\r\nYears later, the general who had inherited the family name forsook his homeland, journeying into the wild borderlands on a quest for vengeance.\r\nEvery time his fingers traced the spear, he was transported back to that long, snowy night outside the ancient palace gates.\r\nThe memory was one that was soaked in sorrow, the words of his old friend — words spoken as he stood before the guillotine — echoing in his mind.\r\nBeneath the sublunary sphere, the world lay shackled by tragic fate, its lost citizens wandering aimlessly through the lands they once called home.\r\nThe Torchforger, bathed in the moon's eternal light, lit the everlasting flame and began his watch."
