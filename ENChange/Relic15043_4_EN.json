  "Relic15043_4_EN.txt": "\r\nOnce there was an age when the silver wheels that guided the primal heavens yet remained three.\r\nAt that time, the laws bestowed from the heavens had yet to be assembled, and the boundaries of humanity had yet to be defined.\r\n\r\nThe sons and daughters of the gods were scattered across the newly-wrought gardens and valleys, their number countless.\r\nThe envoys of the sky walked among benighted human crowds then, sowing prosperity and wisdom.\r\nIn the end, the prosperity promised by the gods kindled the flame of intellect, which in turn stirred the whispers of doubt.\r\n\r\nIn quest of the answer, the people chose their priests; in fear of the answer, the priests anointed their kings.\r\nMortal folly stirred the ire of the gods' envoys. Faced with their questions, the divine envoys uttered no word.\r\nAnd so the people turned their gazes toward the sky, offering sacrifices to the three bright moons in the dark, sunless night.\r\n\r\nAbove the night sky, the daughters of dreams and poetry kept vigilant, unceasing watch over the mortal world's every change.\r\nIn the deep slumber of the Arianrhod Realm, at the foot of the seventy-tiered staircase, beside the gleaming silver vessels.\r\nUntil they heard that the hearts of these pitiful little humans would also stir with the lunar quakes...\r\n\r\nThe night cast its eyes upon the earth, just as the silver stars once lit the way for the dragons' sky-faring ships.\r\nThey brought madness and inspiration back beneath the moon. It was a reply that Order could not give.\r\nWhen the morning star rose again, the <color=#e72613>archpriestess</color> <color=#1dd215>archpriest</color> returned from the mountain's summit with a small circular talisman.\r\nThis \"Moon Wheel\" was the new pact between the three moons and the people."
