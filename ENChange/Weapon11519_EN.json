  "Weapon11519_EN.txt": "\r\nPassing through layers of rocky ridges, the hidden spring of a forgotten tomb absent from all chronicles finally revealed itself at dusk.\r\nA whispered tale it was, that ran only among the mining tribes, speaking of an adeptus who forged swords from flowing light, an adeptus who once vanished into the watery moon beneath the depths.\r\nSeeking traces of that adeptus, the girl ventured into the shadowed gorge, landing softly among the pines on her climbing sandals.\r\nNo one was around; only moonlight spilled through the narrow clefts, sketching half-formed phantoms behind bamboo curtains.\r\n\r\n\"In ages past, before Mt. Tianheng rose, and the seas still knew no calm, there was a kingdom named Lang-Gan on the western coast.\"\r\n\"With roasted millet and boars <color=#e72613>proffered</color> <color=#1dd215>proferred</color>, beating earthen drums on wicker stands, the people honored the gods with utmost sincerity.\"\r\n\"Thus the Heavenly being descended, teaching them to till earth and sow grains, to spin thread and weave cloth.\"\r\n\"And thus it was proclaimed: Fair shall be the fortune of your kingdom, long-enduring as the Heavens; vast shall be the blessings of your <color=#e72613>realm</color> <color=#1dd215>kingdom</color>, limitless as the Earth itself...\"\r\n\r\nBut the mighty dragon who once stood alongside the Lord of Geo could not escape sudden ruin, trampling the flourishing lands of humanity's master.\r\nThe mountain folk could only take up their ancestors' weapons and follow the Yaksha beneath that lord's banner, resisting the calamity that descended from the Heavens.\r\nSearching for the sword that would save them from calamity, the daughter of the sheer cliffs and crystal sands followed ancient songs, at last reaching the kingdom of her forebears, hidden within the caverns.\r\nHearing now her purpose declared, the silver shadow seemed to stir with a soft laughter, rippling along with the spring under the moon.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! The path of the Heavens is ever-shifting and unknowable; fortune and woe are intertwined and unpredictable.\"\r\n\"In those days, a blazing comet fell from the East, descending upon the <color=#e72613>western</color> <color=#1dd215>Western</color> frontiers. Unrest followed in its wake...\"\r\n\"Thereafter, the <color=#e72613>heavens</color> <color=#1dd215>Heavens</color> toppled and the sea lay in ruin; the <color=#e72613>earth</color> <color=#1dd215>Earth</color> was swallowed into chasms, deep as the whale dives. The <color=#e72613>people</color> <color=#1dd215>folk</color> perished, and the realm was left to woe...\"\r\n\"Glorious blooming flowers and splendid woven brocades are naught but reflections on water, phantoms in mirrors. Eternal prosperity — how could it ever be attained?\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the stone fortresses in the mountains would one day crumble into jade<color=#e72613>-colored</color> ruins, becoming Glazed Sand Crystals in the hands of merchants.\r\nBut to the <color=#e72613>young </color>girl, such things <color=#e72613>were</color> <color=#1dd215>belong</color> <color=#e72613>yet</color> <color=#1dd215>to</color> a hundred generations <color=#e72613>off</color> <color=#1dd215>hence</color>. They <color=#e72613>were</color> <color=#1dd215>are</color> idle tales for the distant future, not for today.\r\nThe shadowed figure casually pulled a wild bamboo stalk from the slanted cliff. The tip broke and fell, but the girl caught it before it touched the ground.\r\n\"As the waxing moon bears its light, one might chase forms and shadows. Now, now... You've understood the true essence of the sword. Why seek its physical form, then?\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that the girl later trained a hundred elite warriors in sword-and-halberd combat. Alongside the Lord of Geo, they subdued the dragon and quelled evil across the land.\r\nBy the time the malevolent demons were vanquished and the world <color=#e72613>was</color> <color=#1dd215>lay</color> <color=#e72613>now </color>in peace, those once-fierce warriors became shrewd merchants haggling over every coin in Shenglu Hall.\r\nToday, it is only when selling their exquisite porcelain, fired from Sand Crystals, that they speak of those ancient, fanciful tales.\r\nThe mountains stand <color=#e72613>silent</color> <color=#1dd215>in their silence</color>, while the cold moon hanging over the harbor city holds vigil, illuminating every river just as it did thousands of years ago."
