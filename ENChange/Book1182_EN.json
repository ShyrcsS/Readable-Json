Analogous to photosynthesis... these plants would autonomously accumulate kuuvahki from their environment, thereby eliminating potential Abyssal corruption...\r\n\r\n...Preliminary experiments indicate that most phenotypic traits of the controlled variants are heritable...\r\n\r\n...A request was submitted to Supervisor Morozov to modify the existing ventilation system by adding pipelines for kuuvahki delivery. Circulation will be maintained by these newly bred plants (currently unnamed)...\r\n\r\n...Although Supervisor Morozov appeared to hold out little hope that we might return to the post-apocalyptic world outside (which is entirely understandable), he nevertheless approved the modification plan...\r\n\r\n...Now, just by opening the <color=#00E1FFFF><color=#e72613>valves</color> <color=#1dd215>valve</color></color>, we will have a continuous supply of kuuvahki that can be recycled...\r\n\r\n...The people, especially the children who followed us here, should not remain in the <color=#e72613>bunker</color> <color=#1dd215>shelter</color> forever. One day, they or their children will discover a new world that has not yet been destroyed. By then, these flowers will help them purify the pitch-black corruption, allowing them to walk proudly under the azure sky..."
