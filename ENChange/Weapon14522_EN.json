At the end of all three ways lay the <color=#e72613>night</color> <color=#1dd215>Night</color> of <color=#e72613>oblivion</color> <color=#1dd215>Oblivion</color>.\r\nThat was the future once lamented by the vanished moons, in the era when three were still three.\r\n\r\nBut, in the dark night, were there truly only three paths that they saw?\r\nIn the memories that belonged to her alone, <color=#e72613>there was </color>a golden star not of this world<color=#e72613>.</color>\r\n<color=#e72613>It</color> <color=#1dd215>Was</color> <color=#e72613>was </color>reflected in the cold, lonely courtyard under the silver moon — that strand of starlight <color=#e72613>had </color>always lingered in her heart...\r\n<color=#e72613>And</color> <color=#1dd215>Linger</color> <color=#e72613>linger </color>it did, even across millions of years, even across countless worlds long extinguished.\r\nThat star, <color=#e72613>which</color> <color=#1dd215>once</color> <color=#1dd215>captured in </color>her gaze<color=#e72613> once had captured</color>, would surely illuminate her journey home...\r\n\r\nIn the next timeless instant of such unwavering belief, begins the era when three are no longer three.\r\nAt the edge of darkness, the Lord of the Crossroads looked back at the fourth path beyond the three-way fork,\r\nAmid honeyed veils of dreamy hues, she tarried silently, waiting for the appointed meeting with her companions beneath the stars.\r\n\r\n\"O little dove, child of the moon,\"\r\n\"Let not sorrow for hardship or parting weigh upon your heart,\"\r\n\"The flowers will bloom once more by your window,\"\r\n\"And the moon will be with you in your slumber by night or day.\""
