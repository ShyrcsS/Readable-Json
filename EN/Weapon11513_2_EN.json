One met with the proud Harmost during the war and ultimately rose to inherit his authority.\\nThe other hid amidst the bones and was taken in by the chieftain of Aremorica, to guard those pure waters not yet seized by the God King.\\nTwo people who had been lulled to sleep by the same lullabies and sea breezes, found themselves now drifting apart, one on each side of the conflict.\\n\\nAnd so, guided by the tides and the whispers of the spirit, the sword-singer of destruction set out on her quest.\\nShe faced unimaginable trials and endured sufferings never before known. Yet, she remained unable to find that Pure Grail.\\nBut it was the heavens who chose the Mistress of Many Waters, commanding her to return from her primeval prison to take over from the golden king and rule the sea-ruins.\\n\\n\"O Mistress of Many Waters, glorious primordial mother, I beg for your wisdom.\"\\n\"For you, I have killed the unrighteous and toppled countless cities.\"\\n\"Please tell me, this I plead, how the descendants of all seas might avoid disaster.\"\\n\"O Mistress of Many Waters, glorious primordial mother, please show mercy, just this once.\"\\n\\nIn the bloodstained dusk, the Queen of All Waters was moved by that plaintive plea.\\nAnd so the kindly goddess told the supplicant what she had once told the King of Fortuna.\\nBut the goddess did not yet know that a self-interested plea could lead only to despair.\\nAnd perhaps for that reason, the collapsing illusion thus dyed that so-called faith in its colors.\\n\\nThe aqua-shaded sword, long stained with blood, fell away, carrying the last thread of reason with it.\\nThe singer who had wielded that sword stumbled from the valley, and she was never to be seen again.\\n\\nThe chieftain who dreamed of honor and glory did not see the land of her dreams, nor would she ever find absolution, much like the god who shared similar hopes.\\nMany years later, when the musician known as the Golden Hunter remembered this name,\\nNeither blood nor tears were in his thoughts. Only the sound of a distant flute, a twisting melody under a watery moon."
