    "Book156_EN.txt": "For the next few days after that night, the fox never came again.\\nBut in those few days, prey in the forest became gradually more abundant.\\nEverything from small finches, long-legged cranes, and even scurrying boars...\\nMaybe it was the change in season, or some sort of repayment from the fox. Whatever the case, the following days brought real stew to the table.\\nBut the fox never came again.\\nAs strange as it may seem, it had honestly been easier to sleep hungry. Even with a full, satisfied stomach, I couldn't help but think about the day we met, and the woman that the fox had turned into...\\nWhen would I gaze upon her eyes again, glittering... like water in a lake.\\nLying half-asleep with a heart full of turmoil, I heard a faint sound outside my door.\\nI hopped from the bed and swung the door open, eager to see a small white silhouette awaiting me.\\nBut there were no lake-blue eyes, and there was no fluffy white foxtail. Instead, all I could see were dandelion seeds drifting in the white moonlight, floating like snowflakes in the air.\\nSuddenly, something got caught in my nostrils.\\n\"Ah-Ahchooo!!!\"\\nImmediately, the fluffy white dandelion seeds began to swirl, filling the sky like a snowstorm.\\nAmidst the flurry of dandelion seeds, a pair of jewel-like eyes were looking at me, staring straight into my heart.\\nWaving away the swirling dandelion seeds, I started walking towards the small fox.\\nThe fox raised its ears and its furry tail flitted across the grass as it turned and disappeared into the depths of the forest.\\nI hurried and followed closely behind.\\nIn amongst the darkness of the trees, soft patches of white could be seen weaving between the shadows.\\nTheir silhouettes tip-toed like moonlight cast among the tree leaves, or like the hesitant strides of a crafty Seelie.\\nWith unfaltering trust, I followed the fox round and about, soon emerging from the dark forest in a seemingly faraway land.\\nThere, in the moonlight, a sea of dandelions lay before me, stretching as far as my eyes could see.\\nStunned by the sight, I began to notice a rustling noise coming from just behind me.\\nIt was a light, delicate sound. Like that of a girl walking barefoot across pine needles and leaves on the ground.\\nThe fox approached me from behind. The night air ferried her presence, cool and damp, whisked together with the slightly bitter fragrance of dandelion flowers.\\nTwo hands with slender, ice-cold fingers rested upon my shoulders.\\nShe leaned in close to my ear and her long hair draped down over my shoulder.\\nBehind me, I felt the soft rhythm of both her breath and her heartbeat. It made me feel calm and at ease.\\n\"Only the foxes know the way to this place. It is the homeland of the dandelions.\\nIt is my desire that you would tarry here, and teach my child human language...\\nIn return, I will teach you the magic of foxes.\"\\nThere was a tickle in my ear, as if one of the dandelion seeds had grazed it on its journey into the warm night air.\\nStrange. I had certainly never mentioned anything about magic to her before. How could she have known?\\nWithout answering, she took my hand and led me into the depths of the sea of dandelions.\\nThe night breezes from both north and south carried the bitter fragrance of dandelion flowers and faded memories...\\nIn those fields of velvet white, she showed me how foxes play gently together in their own fashion, until the moon rose high into the starry sky."
