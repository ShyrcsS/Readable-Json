Ahead of you, everything is engulfed by fog.\\nThough the way ahead seems unclear at the moment, all will become clear when the time comes.\\nTake this opportunity to improve yourself while waiting for the clouds to clear.\\n\\nYour lucky object for the day: Luminescent Spine\\nThe Luminescent Spine shines with a faint glow, but shines strong nonetheless.\\nThough it may not be the brightest of lights, it is enough to illuminate the road ahead."
