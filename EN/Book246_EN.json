Yeah, I guess you could say that...\"\\nThe talkative young girl, who claimed to be a shikigami, gulped down glutinous-rice dango with such speed and intensity that Hamavaran began to worry she might choke.\\n\\n\"If I had to explain it, I'd say my situation is more like that of a 'ghost-calling.'\"\\n\"So like I said, a ghost...\"\\n\"Noooo, not that kind of ghost!\"\\nOne argument later, Hamavaran finally understood that what she called \"ghost-calling\" was something roughly equivalent to what in Sumeru is known as \"spirit-warding.\"\\nBoth involve signing a pact using one's real name. The notion that you can command someone when you know their real name is common to many of the world's mystic traditions, and it highlights a core fear held by humans: the fear of being under someone else's control.\\n\\nWith thoughts thusly wandering, Hamavaran once again began to regret specializing in the much-neglected discipline of marine biology instead of mysticism...\\nFirst I have to sail all the way to Inazuma, then I have to go through the living hell that is a thesis defense...\\nBut maybe running into this noisy little thing is a stroke of good luck for me..."
