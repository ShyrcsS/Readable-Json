    "Book84_EN.txt": "Down every street in Mondstadt have I strolled.\\nThe air was filled with the stench of misery and the buzz of revelry.\\nI saw the most arrogant of aristocrats,\\nAnd I saw the most pitiful of the impoverished.\\nAt night these streets are a spider's web — some here to feast, others their eternal prey.\\nI hear a jangling in the night, and know it is the chains that fetter the souls of the oppressed.\\n\\nI patrol the streets of Mondstadt at nighttime,\\nWhere my peers and superiors would once declare:\\n\"We are the starlit knights, lift thy heads and bear witness!\"\\n\"For we, who raise our flag in the splendor of starlight, are the true protectors of Mondstadt!\"\\nBut not once have I lifted my head to the stars, or gazed at our flag:\\nFor I cannot shift my focus from the filthy street corners.\\n\\nDestitute peddlers weep in silence.\\nAging soldiers grimace in pain.\\nIn the deathly stillness of night,\\nA young girl, rejected by the Aristocracy, pleads for Barbatos' mercy.\\nThe sighing of mournful winds rattles the Cathedral gate,\\nCarrying with them the grief of the oppressed, they assault splendid palatial walls.\\n\\nEach mother's call,\\nEach infant's cry,\\nEnough to dent the hardest of shields.\\nEnough to shatter the sharpest of swords.\\n\\nSounds of sorrow send shivers down my spine.\\nBut in the palace, and in the castle,\\nThough the wind blows the same over holy ground,\\nThey are but the sighs of ants to the ears of men."
