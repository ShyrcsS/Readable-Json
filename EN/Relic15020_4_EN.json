Well, if you wish to abandon your past, allow me to give you a new name.\"\\nAfter hearing about his past, the girl who possessed jet black wings sneered disdainfully.\\n\"Well, you shall be called Iwakura. 'The seat of rock.' A name that human words cannot harm.\"\\n\"Come on, mortal in whose veins runs the blood of the oni, be glad. Smile a little!\"\\n\"You should know that names given by us Yougou Tengu are blessed with divine powers.\"\\n\"Besides, the name 'rock' suits you — it certainly suits your mind and your muscles, that's for sure.\"\\n\\n\"Well then, when the cherry blossoms fall next year, let's have a duel here, 'Iwakura.'\"\\n\"Child of the oni, hone your swordsmanship and become a foe whom the Yougou Tengu would not be ashamed to cross swords with.\"\\n\"Ah, yes! If you manage to touch me, you'll get to call your secret blade 'Tengu Victor'!\"\\n\"After all, if you get to that point, you'll have a sword that'll let you 'triumph over the tengu.'\""
