    "Book757_EN.txt": "...\\nSalvation is meaningless if only a few can be saved. Were these words to be spoken by one of noble character, that would be all.\\n...when the issues of cost and efficiency cannot be resolved, allowing the few to be saved is the best choice.\\n...the underwater shelter is undoubtedly a technical success, but even if we ignore cost issues, it's still a stop-gap measure at best.\\nThe Arkhium Project has greater potential. But the forging can only realize a fragment of its potential, and that is an experimentally proven fact.\\nAnother project criticized as being purely ornamental...\\nSaid ornamental value is an objective fact, but it is useless to science...\\nArkhium is rather ornamental too, but its beauty is worthless if it cannot serve the well-being of Fontaine's people."
