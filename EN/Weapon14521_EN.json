The robes of those who speak idly of virtue conceal nothing but festering weakness and fatigue.\"\\n\"It is this very weakness that brought down the sapphire domes, and it is this very weakness that has driven the people to cry out in sorrow.\"\\n\\nThe sage monk burst out in laughter, though he did not directly address the youthful noble's answer.\\nNonetheless, he handed him the Staff of Falsehoods.\\n\\nAnd this was how Goudarz's name became lost to history...\\nTo be replaced by the mighty title of King Saleb Dowleh.\\nThe warrior who once would brook no lies had gained kingly power through cunning.\\nCasting the illusion of a golden age over the fading hues of twilight.\\n\\n...\\n\\nIt was not until even the most perfect lie could no longer control his insatiable thirst for power...\\nUntil King Deshret's creations could no longer fabricate the illusion of divine manifestation...\\nUntil the voice of the Ibis King rose once more to ask him that very same question...\\nThat the aged king gave his final answer amid the laments of Gurabad:\\n\\n\"O Holy One, all I speak are lies. Even I do not trust my own words.\"\\n\"The only thing I can do now is fight to the death. At the very least, I shall not betray once more the trust of the brothers who have come to my rescue.\"\\n\"O, Holy One, whether you seek truth or falsehood, you must taste it in your own blood.\"\\n\\nHis kingly power was seized by the Deys of other tribes, and on and on it went, until the various kingdoms were ground to dust by the desert winds.\\nAnd, as if collecting moonlight like amber honey, the holy one had taken the king's last will as his final answer."
