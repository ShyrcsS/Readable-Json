    "Book665_EN.txt": "To my love, my dearest Monsieur Neuvillette,\\nI know not how many days and nights have passed since our previous trial. My dreams have been filled with longing for your face, so kind, so handsome. It excites me, agitates me to know that I shall be leaving this place, and that I shall see you once more. As I said, I will do anything, anything to see you again! And I can wait no longer — indeed, not one moment more — for you to castigate me, your humble \"defendant.\"\\nAnd this time, I promise, I swear, you will remember my name!\\n\\nYour admirer, White Lily."
