Mom says we have to keep our new address a secret for now, so I'll share it with you next time. Hee-hee.\\nThanks to you guys, I think I can say that I found my own answer this time.\\nAlso, it turns out that Mr. Curve is the kind of person who can't tell a lie! I super admire that. He will always be like a big brother to me!"
