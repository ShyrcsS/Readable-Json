    "Book688_EN.txt": "Common problems and appropriate emergency response measures are listed in this manual. If an error not included in the manual occurs, please contact Senior Researcher Bravais at once.\\n\\nCommon errors include the following:\\nInsufficient Energy Supply:\\nThis error is usually caused by insufficient pipe pressure, specifically when an indicator gas leak occurs from the valve or exterior surface of the pipe. To address this, adjust the valve by turning the handwheel until the valve is no longer leaking indicator gasses.\\nSystem Overheated:\\nThis error indicates the press temperature is too high. In this state, the entire system is more hazardous. Addressing this is a high priority. The recommended method is to decrease the temperature of the press's ventilation window and initiate the cooling program to dissipate the heat.\\nWater Entering the System:\\nWhen this error occurs, abort the process and perform an inspection of the environmental sealing to prevent reoccurrence. In case of emergency, the emergency drainage function can also be activated to temporarily address the unexpected presence of excess water.\\nBlocked Emergency Drainage Pipe:\\nThis error is normally caused by a foreign substance blocking the drainage pipe. When this error occurs, simply inspect and clear the drainage pipe.\\n\\nRepair Requests & Feedback Log:\\n...\\nRepair Request: Evidence of leakage on the ground found near the cooling system water intake under the press. Requesting urgent maintenance.\\nMaintenance Outcome: Temporary sealant has been applied to the water intake to prevent water ingress. Due to the risk of backflow when using the cooling system, its use has been suspended until a permanent solution can be implemented."
