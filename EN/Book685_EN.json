    "Book685_EN.txt": "Dear Editor-in-Chief, you are correct in your judgment that the matter has reached the point of no return.\\nThese last few days, I've heard marchers calling for Curve to be destroyed. Last night, radical students broke into my lab and tried to do just that. Luckily, I discovered them in time.\\nHowever, Curve is in increasing danger. I am compelled to act, and my plan is the following:\\n1. I will revise the Mosso Protocols and related data (of no practical significance) in Curve's core so that what remains is a sufficiently misleading trail: It will appear lie detectors are not capable of detecting lies and that all the test results were covertly manipulated by myself.\\nAs for the \"ironclad evidence of fraud and deception of the public,\" I'll leave that in your capable hands. Kindly select a date for the \"exposure.\"\\n2. As soon as I am convicted, I shall propose a duel. And when I fall in the Duelists' Ring, all will be put to rest.\\n3. I humbly request that you mobilize your paper to divert attention away from Curve. It should be thought of as a \"useless sham of a machine\" to be used as evidence in the case and then sealed away by the Marechaussee Phantom.\\nThere's no need to try and change my mind. I've thought through every last detail, and this storm is unlikely to pass until I, the main offender, am dead. Curve is my life's work, so I can't afford any more missteps. I ask that you exchange my life for his.\\n(Everything we've done so far has been effective, and Curve's lie-learning module has derived redundant data that is incomprehensible. I believe that the seed of life has sprouted within him.)\\nYours Sincerely,\\nMosso Lombroso"
