Though it was most tiring\\nto help the old lady on the bridge\\nmove her barrels of hard apple cider,\\nthey each got a small barrel as their\\nreward.\\nThe moonlight was unobstructed\\nand beautiful, and the two good\\nfriends climbed up the high wall that had\\nbeen built to stave the evil dragon off.\\nAlberto lost the rock-paper-scissors match,\\nso he had to hold the barrel of\\ncider under the crook of his arm\\nas they climbed the ladder.\\n\"Look, this is the big house\\nthat our chubby chief was so proud of!\\nDoesn't look so big from here, huh?\"\\nsaid Alberto\\nas he looked at the house.\\n\"You're wrong. That's my home,\"\\nsaid Galileo.\\n\"The chief's house is that one.\"\\nAlberto's night vision was not all\\nthat good, and moonlight\\ncould never compare to daylight.\\nIf one were to close one's eyes,\\nthe light could not be seen at all.\\nHe tried a little harder, but\\ncould discern nothing more.\\n\"But it's also really small,\"\\nGalileo continued, \"so there's\\nnothing wrong with your statement.\"\\nGalileo and Alberto were both\\nrather perceptive\\npeople. Galileo's reply covered\\nfor Alberto's\\ndiscomfort regarding his poor vision,\\nwhile Alberto also lost\\nthe rock-paper-scissors match on purpose,\\nso that he could carry\\nthe cider barrel, because\\nthe gears under Galileo's ribs\\nwere injured.\\n\"Here's to you.\"\\nThe two friends raised a toast\\nonce Alberto stuffed a cork\\nback into the barrel.\\n\\nThe next day, the two\\ngathered everyone in the village\\nplaza.\\nFirst, they apologized for the collapse\\nof the anti-dragon wall, and told\\nall the people that they were preparing\\nto have a talk with the evil dragon.\\n\"I know it was a lot of work for\\neveryone to fix that wall, but we're\\nnot that fussed about it anyway,\"\\nthe chubby chief said, \"but are you\\nsure you're not bragging when you say\\nyou knocked it down yourselves?\"\\nOf course, that was not the chief's point.\\nHe too was a good\\nperson. He continued, \"Also,\\nit's too dangerous\\nto seek the dragon out.\"\\n\"Don't worry about us.\"\\nAnd so, the two best friends\\nin the whole world departed.\\n\\nThe evil dragon trembled\\nbefore Alberto and Galileo.\\nFor some reason, the old lady's liquor\\ncould make people\\ngrow very, very large.\\nThat was how they accidentally squashed\\nthe high walls the previous night.\\nAs they gazed down at the ground far below,\\nthey more or less understood\\nhow the dragon thought.\\nNo wonder it could accidentally\\ndestroy the village at its feet. So\\nas long as they could\\nget the dragon to notice\\npeople, they could surely\\ncome to an understanding.\\nThe two friends thus drank\\nall the remaining magic cider, becoming\\neven larger than the dragon\\nby a good margin.\\nReeking of alcohol, they sandwiched\\nthe dragon between them, and drunkenly\\ntried reas█ni█g with it.\\nThe drag█n ██riveled up in terror,\\nall of its m███sty and fell aura\\nforever gone, indeed,\\nit even looked kind of pitiful.\\nAlberto attempted to pick dirt\\noff the scales on the dragon's back,\\nbut wound up picking off an entire scale.\\nThe dragon sought to flee,\\nbut Galileo, fearing that the crisis might\\npersist for ten thousand years more\\nif the misunderstanding was not cleared up,\\ntugged its tail and dragged it right back.\\n\"To be honest, we've always lived\\nunder your feet, but we\\nare far too small, so you may not have ever\\nseen us. Now, we've transformed and\\nbecome *burp* big.\" Galileo said, \"So now,\\nsurely, you must know\\nthat we dwell at your feet.\"\\nThe dragon nodded repeatedly.\\nAnd thus did the two and the dragon\\nchat all night, and believing\\nthe goal of mutual understanding\\nachieved, the two set off\\nalong the road home.\\n\\nA.A.\\n"
