Yet how easy it is to conquer the tides; how difficult the human heart.\"\\nFilled with regret, the hero Uenuku wandered every inch of the scorched lands, searching only for his beloved.\\nAfter decades of relentless pursuit, the water sprite's hardened heart softened, finally showing a trace of compassion.\\nShe plucked a soft cloud from the sky and turned it into a rainbow, guiding the hero towards the sea's other side.\\nBlessed by the Sacred Flame, Uenuku and his lover were finally reunited, never to be separated again.\\nThe tribal elders believe that the shells we see today are fragments of the rainbow that fell into the sea back then,\\nAnd that the reason they are always formed with two connected sides is because they symbolize our wish for reunion."
