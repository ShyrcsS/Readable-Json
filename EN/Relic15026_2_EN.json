    "Relic15026_2_EN.txt": "\\n\"In the new world, everything shall be good.\"\\nIn ancient times, the edict of the high heavens descended into silence, and the land lost its master.\\nThe past, one of civilization and ease, was abandoned, submerged in choking darkness.\\n\\nLater, the law, which even time could not reverse, would once again take the measure of all life in the desert.\\nA feather to weigh hearts, and molten metal to measure divine wisdom, both ruling with selfless rationality.\\nObeying the judgment of the God King, the law rooted in blood would be carved upon the desert paradise.\\nAnd when the ideals of governance were twisted by deep sorrow, the dignitaries became abettors,\\nIgnoring the palace foundations even as they gradually sank into the quicksand, moving forward toward an insane, light-less future.\\n\\n\"All betrayals must be mercilessly judged,\"\\n\"And the judgment must be utter devastation.\"\\nLater, the rules would be corrupted by pride and become shackles,\\nAnd the unfortunate citizenry would have their destinies chained by their God King's choice."
