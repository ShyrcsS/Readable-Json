But ah, how I wish to hear her sing again.\"\\n\"At least Arundolyn and Roland are alright. When she returns, this calamity should have blown over.\"\\n\\nThe songs in praise of the archon and tunes that recorded the battle of the two dragons were many, but all slowly became lost.\\nThe song the girl loved to sing, too, changed upon her return.\\n\"The dandelions carry in the summer wind,\"\\n\"Autumn brings the fragrance of grain.\"\\n\"But no wind in any season on earth\"\\n\"Shall have you gaze upon me again.\"\\n\\nAnd after her voice and her tears had run dry, the girl swore to use her life's flame to cleanse the world's crookedness.\\n"
