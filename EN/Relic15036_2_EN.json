The craftsman saw the same hatred he nursed burning within her eyes.\\n\\n\"Then I shall gladly serve you...r lord,\" he said, before she had even spoken of her purpose.\\nIn his heart, he was actually willing to serve her, but that was not something he needed to say.\\nFor he could see that at this time, someone else already occupied the girl's heart."
