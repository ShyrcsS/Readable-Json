    "Book651_EN.txt": "At first, all was still, apart from the curtains in the breeze,\\nAnd the faint sounds of animals chewing, echoing through the walls from some unknown place.\\nThen, an odd rasping laugh erupted from an empty room,\\nA nameless horror spreading in the dark.\\nThen, with terrible thunder and storm,\\nA glowing red fog-cloud,\\nEmbraced the castle just like a shroud.\\nOn the castle's great central stage, a tall thin figure did appear,\\nA dark spirit in black robes, arriving at last.\\nThe guests, a moment ago enjoying their revels,\\nFell to the floor one by one,\\nBereft of time even to scream.\\nThe master sat shivering and still on his throne,\\nHis soul also snatched by the dark.\\nAmid the roar of brick and tile hitting the ground,\\nThe castle's glory faded into the past,\\nSwallowed by glimmering waves.\\nThe blood moon the towers once blocked reappeared in the sky,\\nIts baleful glow sweeping the land.\\nAnd today, by the banks of the world's purest lake,\\nThe water reflects the long-fallen, faded castle.\\nThe joy and brilliance that once lit its halls,\\nConsigned to legends and dreams.\\nThe ruins lie suffocated in the gloom.\\nThrough shattered windows, statues appear as like to monsters,\\nWho with the discordant tune that played sank with the castle into the sea.\\nThere is nothing there now, bar darkness, death, and loss."
