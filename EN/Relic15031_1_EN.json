    "Relic15031_1_EN.txt": "\\nOnce, this wine vessel belonged to one who rendered great service to the Court of Fontaine.\\nThose who find themselves doing certain work, unless they be born ruthless and cruel,\\nWill eventually walk down the path to total collapse should they go without the elixir within.\\n\\nThis belonged to one who had to do what had to be done for Fontaine's peace.\\nIt was only many years after he retired due to injury, during his final investigation, that he realized...\\n...No wonderland lay in welcome down the rabbit hole — only the maelstrom.\\n\\n...\\nMemories arose like bubbles from a ruptured diving mask.\\nHe thought of his youth, of the games he would play with Dwight, Basil, and Karl.\\nIn those days, he always played the hero, and Karl would be Jabberwock the evil dragon,\\nHe thought of the embrace of the Director, so dear and familiar, and he felt so similarly in this moment.\\nHe recalled the countless faces warped by hate in the crimson flames of Poisson,\\nAnd then he recalled that he, too, had sent innocent children to the Narzissenkreuz Institute.\\n\\nIn the end, what came clearest to him was what he had felt upon meeting his \"son\" and \"daughter.\"\\nIt was like seeing light at the end of a long tunnel, like seeing himself before he had worn the mask.\\nBut much like clinging to a spider's thread futilely in the dark pits of hell—\\n\"My dear Alain, my dear Mary-Ann... I was never close to you,\"\\n\"And even at the end, I do not know how I could be a \"father\" to you.\"\\n\"But still, I do not wish to lose these memories of watching the two of you growing up...\"\\n—When he awoke from his stupor, all glories, all shame, all love and obsession — they had been dissolved in the waters."
