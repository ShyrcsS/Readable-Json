Hahahahaha!\\n\\nI recently ran into a new Fontainian friend, and he said they've got a music festival called the \"Iridescence Tour\" over there! Now, yours truly instantly thought of that Drumalong Festival we had last time, and how we drummed it up on Amakane Island, singing and scarfing Roasted Lavender Melons! Aw yeah, now those are some great memories! You haven't forgotten either, right, compadre? (But yeah it'd be great if you could forget the part about the Tenryou Commission botching their jobs and arresting me, totally by mistake.)\\n\\nSo this time, I've decided to work with my new pal and host an even bigger, even badder, even wilder musical party, and it's gonna be called the Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness! Whaddaya think? Doesn't the name alone just set your soul on fire?\\nSo stop dragging your feet and get your tushy on over to Watatsumi Island, 'cuz the One and Oni has still got a lot to say.\\n\\nBe there or be square!\\nIf you're a no-show then there's no show!\\n\\nDisclaimer: Of course I didn't have Shinobu transcribe this for me!\\n                       (He totally did)"
