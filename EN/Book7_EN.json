He then spoke in a more serious tone.\\n\"May my teacher's wishes ride the wind and reach the Anemo Archon.\"\\nA wind blew past us and swept away the dandelion seeds.\\nDid they fly to a better place, carrying my hopes and dreams there with them?\\n\\nWhen did this happen?\\nSome time ago, behind the village, there grew a forest of countless lush trees. At the center of this forest was a small lake.\\nThe lake was like the stained glass windows of Mondstadt Cathedral: crystal clear and shimmering in the sunlight.\\nThe sun shone through the treetops and glistened on the water's surface like fragments of gemstone. It was really something.\\nThe weather was cool that day. I was hunting in the forest when I arrived at the lake's edge. The shimmering water somehow reminded me of a girl I loved a long time ago.\\nI couldn't remember much about her, but felt that her eyes must have looked like the lake, glittering as if harboring fragments of gemstone within.\\nI became lost in thought as I stared at the glistening water. Walking transfixed along the lakeside, I had forgotten entirely that I was out for a hunt.\\nI came to when I heard the sound of something freezing up. It was a Mist Flower growing by the lake, having just frozen the water around it. Next to it was a white fox, its tail frozen in the ice. Poor critter.\\n\"It must have had its tail in the water by the Mist Flower while it was drinking.\"\\nMist Flowers are dangerous plants and can cause frostbite if handled without care. Extreme caution must be taken when handling them.\\nAs it saw me approach, the fox struggled in fear, but its still-frozen tail kept it rooted to the spot. The fox whimpered in pain.\\n\"Oh no, this won't do.\"\\nI thought to myself.\\n\"Poor critter. It's gonna die anyway if I don't save it, may as well end its pain by bringing it home as my game for the day.\"\\nI imagined what a delicious fox stew I could cook with the carrots I grew. Just thinking about it gave me energy and brought a smile to my face.\\nSo I took out my hunting bow and slowly walked toward it.\\n\"Be good and stay put.\""
