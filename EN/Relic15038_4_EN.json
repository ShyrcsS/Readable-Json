    "Relic15038_4_EN.txt": "\\nIn the days when the dispossessed divine envoy fell into realms devoid of light, and when the ruler newly returned destroyed the blasphemous citadel,\\nMany stories transpired that were never recorded or eulogized in any human history.\\n\\nIn the kingdom of vishaps lucky enough to survive when heaven and earth collapsed, isolated by a vast sea of red soil,\\nWhere their kin could only scrape by, impoverished, in the expanse of the desolate sea, they enjoyed freedom by the grace of the one who ruled over flames.\\nAnd yet the wisdom of fire had already been seized by the tide of feculent darkness, only its gray corpse shambled on.\\nTo maintain dragonkind's remnant might, their blind, foolish heirs took violence for the rule of law.\\nIn this land of cinder soon to vanish, upon which the sun had set, only one \"human\" cast their gaze toward the begloomed future.\\n\\n\"I see light fall upon the rootless earth, the dragons prostrating before their ruler's deathbed.\"\\n\"I see great wisdom, great art, great civilization — and all shall perish.\"\\n\"But endless cycles are the law of the world, and history will not cease on account of our sorrows.\"\\n\"But tragic are my kin, for they see not how their folly serves to aid history's iron rule.\"\\n\"Servants today shall be rulers tomorrow. Past slaves shall be future masters.\"\\n\"Our race is mired in spiraling contradiction inexorable. Only in sowing seeds shall we find salvation.\"\\n\"Perhaps, out there in the abundant primordial wilderness, there is a land that has yet to know the touch of filth and decay.\"\\n\\nThus, passing through searing flame and raging wind, it took as-yet unextinguished primordial kindling from the ancient palace beneath the magma.\\nBearing the hopes of another race, the wisest of dragons bid farewell to the splendorous city ineffable."
