    "Book876_EN.txt": "I once crossed the layers of clear waters, visiting the corridor beneath the lake.\\nAnd once crossed the boundless valley, reaching the ruined city in the east.\\nI once conquered the golden sands blotting out the skies, seizing the treasures of the dead.\\nAnd once conquered the boundless blue, unearthing the buried secrets of deserted islands.\\nBut the more I obtained, the emptier I felt.\\nNo amount of treasure could fill the hole in my heart.\\nUntil I met the great sage Ruggiero,\\nThrough his teachings, my inner peace was restored.\\nI used the wealth accumulated over long years to aid him in rebuilding this town,\\nAnd divided the remainder into four parts, hiding them on this island.\\n\\nFacing the heart of the mountains,\\nSeeking the eye of the springs,\\nReach the corner's apex,\\nGazing at the distant island of pouring pearls.\\n\\nIf you want it, then go look for it. The wise will always find the answer.\\n\\nJuliano, an ordinary villager"
