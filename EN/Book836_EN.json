People are lying all over the place, splayed out on the ground like alpacas in their pen, and there's a foul stench in the air...\\n\\n...No one had the strength to bury her, so we just threw her into a ditch...\\n\\n...They're all cursing and swearing... But who exactly should they direct their hatred at? Even they can't say...\\n\\n...Just like they said, everyone's working for themselves, for their brothers and sisters in the alliance, not for the evil dragons that once enslaved us... But it's not like they can curse themselves...\\n\\n...Just have to do it... If we can't finish digging this ditch in the next five days, we'll lose our rations... And then we'll all die, just like the ones who were in charge of the pumps...\\n\\n...What even lies down there, under the water? Who knows... Whatever it is, it's not going to save us."
