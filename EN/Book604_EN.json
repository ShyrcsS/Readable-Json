As such, I will record their locations here...\\n\\n...There is no detailed information on the key contents of the ritual. I have drawn the following inferences from a comprehensive review of the current body of research:\\nFirstly, the element of the Korybantes matches the element recorded on the drum score.\\nThis is obvious, and requires only a rudimentary understanding.\\nAnemo and Geo Drums do not exist. The reason for this merits further investigation.\\nSecondly, the meaning behind the notation.\\nNotation may be divided into three categories: empty, half-full, full. The hypothesis is that the musical notes refer to three types of rhythms, namely: pause, light, and heavy.\\nThirdly, the order of reading.\\nUnable to be determined. If a lost Kory Drum is found, one can try to read it in the usual order, which is from left to right and top to bottom."
