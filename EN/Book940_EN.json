    "Book940_EN.txt": "So did the wise dragon's obsidian gate close for Maawe, and so disappointed, Maawe left.\\nAs they descended the mountain, the Monetoo — having accompanied Maawe all this way — began to lose its light and warmth, being far from phlogiston-rich lands as it was. It turned as pale as ash, and its song grew distant and faint.\\nDespondent and begrieved, Maawe desperately sought a way to save its companion. But still the obsidian gate stayed firmly shut, the wise dragon undeigning to behold the youngling again.\\n\"...Scatter me in a pool of sulfur, bury me in the icy depths...\"\\nThis was the voice that Maawe heard. Monetoo are unable to speak, but Maawe did not know this. And so, it decided to fulfill its companion's wish.\\nAfter walking for untold hours, seeing through countless mirages, and surviving innumerable trials of deadly peril, Maawe arrived at a hot spring full of sulfurous pools. Uninhabitable for living beings, it was a place where even getting close might result in being burned by toxic gases and scorched by boiling acid.\\nBut miraculously, as Maawe scattered its companion's form into the sulfur, the boiling acid transformed into a clear spring before its very eyes.\\nIt was from this spring that the first poets of our tribe were born. As we Meztli say, \"Poets and bards are born of sulfur\" — for their words are scalding indeed.\\nSo did the young Maawe create Natlan's first hot spring.\\nAnd so did Maawe make the hot spring its home. Its four limbs transformed into beautifully streamlined fins, its thin body became round, and thus it became the first of the Koholasaurs.\\nOf course, Maawe did not forget its companion. How could it have forgotten the friend that had journeyed with it all that way?\\nMaawe passed on all of the songs it had heard and learned to the humans born from the springs. That's right — to our ancestors. And to this day, the songs that we Meztli continue to pass down are echoes from that ancient era."
