Let our marching boots shake the earth like thunder!\"\\n\"You who will march with us towards the polestar of the white night, come! We shall never abandon you.\"\\n\"You who will walk with us into the land of darkness, come! We shall create a new world together.\"\\n\\n\"Know that the destruction of all precedes the birth of a new order.\"\\n\"At devastation's end, we will greet a stainless dawn.\"\\n"
