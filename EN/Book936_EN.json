Is modifying it to power it all with lava from Natlan even feasible...?\\n— Alright, Vasily, no point flipping through this manual any longer. Just keep your eye on these machines, humming and whirring away...\\n\\n(Below this section is written...)\\n— Fine, as requested by Vasily, I hereby declare the following: I promise not to accidentally lock myself in the cage again, nor will I attempt to smash open the lock, thereby necessitating the activation of the braking system... On top of this, I solemnly swear that I will thoroughly read through this manual, cross my heart and hope to die. That's gotta be good enough, yeah?\\n— You'd better make good on that, Sidorenko. Seriously, if I have to catch those crazy little critters and put them all back in the cage one more time..."
