But there is one story that they all believe.\\nThey believe that Rex Lapis once wielded a spear that pierced the rainbow, pinning the churning vortex that had once terrorized the oceans in the center of the deep sea.\\n\\nLegends have it that since then, one can often see dolphins and whales congregate about that patch of ocean, singing.\\nSome hold that they mourn for the god that they revered, and sing many a winding dirge for it.\\nOthers claim that they do so in awe of Rex Lapis' great power, that he could indeed pierce the rainbow's arc and bring down the sun.\\n\\nBut folk legend also holds this.\\nThat one day, the vortex, consigned to a dead stillness by the Lord of Geo's divine spear, will once again begin to wake.\\nWhen the wind once again brings the stench of the depths onshore, that will be the omen of a hurricane as large as a nine-headed hydra.\\nWho, then, will be able to subdue That Which Lies in the Deep?\\n"
