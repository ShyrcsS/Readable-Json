Her grandmother, who had raised her, certainly never distinguished between them.)\\nThe young handmaiden, with unwavering faithfulness, carried out every last one of the venerable Archpriestess's commands.\\nShe never defied that kind and gentle old grandmother, no matter how dreadful the punishments cloaked by her soft words.\\nWhether someone's thread was to be severed by a sharp silver blade, or another's singing voice must be silenced in the dead of night,\\nAll sins were borne to purify the holy blood bestowed by the moon, for only by drinking crimson water could one hone absolute flawlessness.\\n\\n\"As you have always done, my Aila — my heart's child, my dearest, my most beloved,\"\\n\"Since he has put his trust in you, use your wisdom to guide him. Set his heart on the right path and lead him to the sanctuary.\"\\n\"The man called Solovei is nothing but a treacherous murderer, and yet, he dares to seek our protection after all the wicked deeds he has committed.\"\\n\"When he comes here, you will thrust your sword through his heart from behind to sever his venomous thread.\"\\n\\nThe only response the Archpriestess got, as ever and always, was silence, and those accustomed to silence from their followers always wind up taking it for consent.\\nThe handmaiden's lengthy years of obedience had long convinced the Archpriestess that all that suffering brought on by impurity had never once stirred resentment in her.\\nBut of course. She was the blessed one. The one destined to bear the Sacred Heir. Of course, she understood that the sacrifices she offered up were in service of a decree a thousand years in the making.\\nSo, even as the pure silver blade pierced her back, the last Archpriestess of the far north could not comprehend the source of the betrayal.\\n\\n\"Heh... Mr. Solovei was right. You were just lying to us, Grandma Lovia.\"\\n\"If that were not the case... why would you bleed dawn-light crimson, rather than moonlit silver, when your thread was cut?\""
