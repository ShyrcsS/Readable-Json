Follow me unto eternity.\"\\n\"For I am the noblest soul in all the Immernachtreich. So long as my heart beats, I shall never forsake you.\"\\nAnd the knights obeyed her:\\n\"Our swords and armor are yours. May they be for you a means to break all shackles and guard against all corruption.\"\\n\"Our true hearts also we give unto you, that they may defend your noble soul.\"\\nThis was their knightly oath, and they would be by her side as she hunted the wicked dragon Tasraque.\\n\\nFor far away, black-hearted Tasraque had ripped and devoured the all-protecting night sky and set up its lair.\\nIt had slithered in the dark, sharpening its fangs and claws, and with its flaming breath it had scorched the Prinzessin's heart, turning her eyes red.\\nThis was the Prinzessin's fated foe, and their showdown was inevitable.\\nBut the prophecy of fate has already been foretold. Fair and pure souls need not fret.\\nSimply open one's eyes and prepare to bear witness, for she shall surely return victorious.\\n—Curtains Fall—</center>\\nNote: According to Flowers for Princess Fischl, Princess Fischl has \"crimson eyes like rubies.\" The actor who plays her is thus advised to make the necessary performative adjustments to maintain faithfulness to the source material."
