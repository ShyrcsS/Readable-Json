    "Book1206_EN.txt": "To Haniyyah and Souka:\\nMy dear friends, it's been far too long. How have you been? And how are your Fungi friends doing?\\nI hear you'll soon be settling down in Bayda Harbor. That's certainly something worth celebrating!\\nWhen the time comes, please let me know. I'll come visit together with Miss Najah.\\nIn addition to some gifts prepared for the two of you, I've also made some little outfits for Twirly-Whirly.\\nNow, there has been one piece of bad news, and one piece of good news of late.\\nThe bad news is about the Wisdom Orb...\\nSome problems can't be solved with money alone. Miss Najah has given it everything she has this whole time, but she remains unable to alter the Orb's underlying mechanisms.\\nAccording to her, the elemental irregularities caused by such devices stem entirely from their operational principles. As long as their core functions are retained, the risks will remain unavoidable.\\nAs a result, everyone is now inclined to abandon this particular technology.\\nThat said, based on your letters and on seeing how happily your Fungus companions have grown over the years, I truly believe that you'll be able to carve out a new path even without the use of any devices. One that allows you to reliably identify friendly Fungus companions and establish a comprehensive set of methods for coexisting with them.\\nThe good news is that the materials you sent, along with the draft of \"On Fungi Communities,\" have provided unparalleled real-world case studies for the field of Fungus Studies.\\nAt present, even Rtawahist students like myself have heard that Fungus Studies has received funding on a scale far beyond anything in the past.\\nIf it one day grows into a major discipline filled with many scholars... Who knows? Perhaps the Akademiya will even invite you over to serve as a consultant, Haniyyah.\\nLet's talk more the next time we meet."
