    "Book39_EN.txt": "—Luhua Pool—\\nTraveling southeast along the Bishui River, I came across a pond at the foot of Mt. Tianheng on the north side. The water is clearer than the sky and the water temperature is similar to a human's body temperature. The water has a sweet aftertaste.\\n\\nA local herb gatherer told me that thousands of years ago, this pond was once a garden. It is said that during the era of the Archon War, two lovers, whose families disapproved of their relationship, made this place their rendezvous. However, the times were merciless, and the man left his lover to follow the Geo Archon. He plunged himself bravely into the conflict as a mortal among gods... and like so many mortals in those dark days, none heard from him again for centuries.\\n\\nThe girl wandered the garden, awaiting the return of her lover. The flowers withered and grass grew in their place. Soaked in a flood, the grass rotted. And when the flood too had subsided, and to dust she had returned, her tears then converged into this pond. Perhaps it was her deep longing that made the water here so clear and gentle.\\nI spent an afternoon here and nodded off while taking a bath in the pond. When I woke up, the stars were already glittering in the night sky.\\n\\nI noticed a baby fox slinking around me, but it got scared and ran away when I looked up.\\n\\nNot until later did I realize that one of my shoes was missing and my bag of provisions had been ransacked.\\n\\nIt took longer than I expected to pack my luggage. My next destination is the delta of the Bishui River in the northeast — Yaoguang Shoal."
