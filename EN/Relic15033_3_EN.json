    "Relic15033_3_EN.txt": "\\nIn the years when the Many Waters converged, the gentle mistress crossed the ruins of ages past and built a new city.\\nThe long night had passed and dawn was breaking: The past had become a shadow of a dream, dissolving with the darkness of the night.\\nThis was the true Golden Age. No more Usurpers obsessed with power, no more barbarians indulging in vengeance,\\nThe glorious symphony would never sound again, only odes to love and verses of justice, blown by the morning breeze to the four corners of the high sea...\\n\\nSuch subject matter easily endures the tides of time, and even today, more than a thousand years hence, the people still ardently enjoy them,\\nSuch as the adventures of the Lochknights, told and retold by generations of poets and playwrights, tales long since known to all and sundry.\\nIt is said that they swore by silver armor to fight alongside the Oceanids, to protect the yet untainted pure dews,\\nIt is said that they travailed through uncounted trials and tribulations before finally finding the legendary Pure Grail, welcoming the return of the Queen of Many Waters...\\n\\n\"The court that gathered great and glorious heroes, knights bathed in the blood of dragons\"\\n\"The mage and noble maiden trapped in tower tall, the journey to seek the sacred vessel\"\\n\\nFeasts and vows, sorrow and farewells, many scenes that exist only in the fantasies of elegant verse, all unveiled before the eyes of \"Erinnyes.\"\\nHowever, that hero who shared her name had nothing to do with her, and the ballads sung of that supposed past are nothing more than dreams of the present."
