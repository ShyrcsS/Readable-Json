    "Book1143_EN.txt": "...\\nThe order of life that leads to its end must remain inviolate.\\nSuch power, no mere mortal can possess.\\nPushing others into the tower of no return and depriving them of their destiny...\\nEven the most merciful judgment would never forgive such a crime.\\nBut how shall sinners fear the questions of restless souls?\\nEven the deepest abyss cannot hide the silver light falling from the high tower.\\nThis is the third of his three major sins.\\n...\\nAs for all of Raimo's crimes,\\nThe moonlight and the Soul Lamp bear witness to them.\\nWith a stone pillar as its seal, and a spell as its shroud,\\nLet the evidence of the Serpent of All Evils' crimes be engraved upon the reefs."
