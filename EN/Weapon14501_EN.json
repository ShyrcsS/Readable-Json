Certain drawings and odes were missing in the copies that survived.\\nHowever, the knowledge passed on in the form of ballads and legends among the general public.\\n\\nThe histories of the thousand winds were not lost, for Barbatos still holds them.\\nWhen Barbatos stood against the shadowy wings of the evil dragon Durin,\\nHe sang to the thousand winds and called upon the Wind Dragon.\\nHe who holds this atlas wields the true names of the thousand winds and all of their powers.\\n\\nNow the skies above Mondstadt are calm and blue.\\nBarbatos and Dvalin have found a new place to call home.\\nThe atlas, meanwhile, has been entrusted to one worthy of the honor.\\n"
