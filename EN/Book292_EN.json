Well, I think you're quite the character, for one.\"\\n\"I don't mean 'thoughts' in that sense.\" Princess Mina sounded quite exasperated now. \"I mean with regards to saving me.\"\\n\"Strictly speaking, I didn't save you.\"\\nThe samurai corrected.\\n\"At that time, you ordered me to take you away in your capacity as princess. In that sense, you saved yourself.\"\\n\"Oh, is that how you see it?\"\\nAn expected reply.\\nWell, the samurai thought, it had been worth a shot trying to dodge responsibility.\\n\\n\"In any case, this 'princess who brings destruction' nonsense... Hah. Isn't that just an excuse for making war?\"\\nThe samurai's lackadaisical tone shifted.\\n\"Also,\"\\nThe samurai turned around, void-like eyes now aflame.\\n\"'Destroying the world' is an utterly stupid concept. You'll understand soon enough.\""
