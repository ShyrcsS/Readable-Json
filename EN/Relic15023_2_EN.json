A good cause indeed.\"\\n\"Yet, if you think about it, this would be akin to a fish sinking into a deep pool or a bird plummeting into a forge.\"\\n\"I may yet achieve my own desire, but we shall go unknown, and ultimately unremembered.\"\\n\"Mortals like us are like feathers caught up in a whirlwind, floating into the deep sky.\"\\n\"Saving, defending... In the end, these are all pointless things, void of meaning.\"\\n\\nThese dark murmurings shook the hearts of those who would never make a name for themselves.\\n\\nBut the battle was over in the end, and many a soldier would rest eternally in the cavernous depths.\\nThe freakish cries of the dark forces were also silenced like fading ripples...\\nAnd though mortal spans are short, the land will forever remember."
