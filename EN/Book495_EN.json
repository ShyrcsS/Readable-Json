How might one mark a grain of sand falling into the desert, or a droplet disappearing into water?\"\\nI believed Jebrael would be the last. He should have been the last.\\nBut who can say? Perhaps the many mishaps broke him, unexpectedly.\\nJebrael, so agile and swift! To think that he would fall off the side of the ruins on the gorge.\\nUnexpected indeed.\\nNow, I and Samail are the only ones left. Yes, we are the last of this little exploration team.\\nThis journey is cursed! But no matter. Soon, it shall reach its end.\\nYes. Soon.\\n\\nTarafa"
