Results remain unsatisfactory as energy is still depleting too quickly.\\n...\\nThe experiment was relocated to a different site, but a Landcruiser became damaged due to an operational error. Chaos ensued. Data was successfully recovered, but additional time had to be spent filing the incident report.\\n...\\nThe new barrier prototype has arrived, now a third of its original size. Initial testing was conducted this morning, and performance was found to be acceptable. However, energy availability over time continues to be bottlenecked.\\n...\\nEnergy consumption model modified, resulting in improved data fit.\\n...\\nDisappointingly, my transfer request has been denied. But I suppose that's not surprising at all. That project is highly classified, with access granted to only a select few.\\nIf more funding were available, perhaps sharing a space with those who tinker with plants or animals might be avoided.
