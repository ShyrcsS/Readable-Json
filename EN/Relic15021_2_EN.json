    "Relic15021_2_EN.txt": "\\nThe long-wandering eccentric no longer thinks about this,\\nBut when he closes his eyes, he can still see the moonlit nights over Tatarasuna and the burning furnace flames.\\nThe kind young deputy said:\\n\"This gold ornament is a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun,\"\\n\"But as you travel the world, please bear this in mind,\"\\n\"Never to reveal your identity to others.\"\\nThe upright Inspector said:\\n\"This gold ornament may be a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun,\"\\n\"But you are neither man nor mechanism,\"\\n\"And so I can only deal with you in this fashion. Do not hold this against me!\"\\n\\nThe wanderer who has left yesterday in the dust no longer thinks about it,\\nBut when he covers his ears, he can still hear the wild winds that roared that year.\\nA pair of expectant eyes said:\\n\"This gold ornament is a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun,\"\\n\"It must surely be able to save the people.\"\\n\\nThe intelligent, lovely shrine maiden said:\\n\"This gold ornament is a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun,\"\\n\"And she will not abandon you.\"\\n\"As for me, I shall do my best to send for help immediately...\"\\n\\n...But in the end, the golden arrow-feather were covered in dust,\\nAnd all tales were incinerated in karmic flames till nothing remained."
