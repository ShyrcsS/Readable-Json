As we lean on each other today, so too will we abandon each other tomorrow.\"\\n\"To lose the freedom which the Jinn are so proud of and a vessel that can partake in joy and love, to feel the diminishment of one's spirit by the day.\"\\n\"The nymph of the water lilies drew mortal kings into her machinations with honey-tinged lies, and the Lord of the Sands sank deep into a dream of madness...\" \\n\"But I have long been waiting — always waiting — in a sleepless dream... Waiting for the King of Sand to fulfill his ancient promise.\"\\n\\nMind and body festooned with wretched machinery, she awaits the end of her mistress' slumber,\\nBearing a sullen hope as she silently guards the broken dreams of this empire of sand.\\nEven should the spring be mixed with bitter gravel, even if the oasis is swallowed by sand...\\nEven amidst the eternal pulsing of machines, she listens for the coming of the footsteps that will bring change.\\n\\n\"But, my teachers so sightless, I was born into a slave's chains, and had everything taken from me when I was young...\"\\n\"Might I, abandoned by the fates like the dunes of sand as I was, be worthy of a change in my fortunes?\"\\n"
