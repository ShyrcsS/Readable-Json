The algorithm has been improved by our project team and has been temporarily designated as the \"Comprehensive Combat Formula\" (CCF).\\nWithin the CCF's data systems, this meka must ultimately reach the following combat and engineering targets:\\n1. As the vanguard, create an opening in the frontlines, withstand enemy attacks seven times those of standard units, and still advance a distance of ten combat platoons.\\n2. While in cruising mode, detect and defeat all monsters on both sides of the route within a distance three times the range of a pistolet.\\n3. Engage and hold off an enemy on the same level as the Emperor of Fire and Iron until reinforcements arrive.\\n4. When encountering an obstacle smaller than a standard three-story Fontainian building, overcome it within half an hour and continue forward.\\n5. When attacking an enemy stronghold, remain unaffected by concentrated attacks from light weapons, destroy the enemy's defensive structures within two hours, and drive the enemy out of their defensive positions.\\nIn order to achieve these targets, the meka will be built in three batches of three, for a total of nine prototypes. The three batch types are listed below:\\nFull System Prototype: Verify the power, movement, and combat systems.\\nInitial Operational Viability: Solve the problems exposed by the prototype batch. Begin beta tester group participation to optimize the meka's structure based on man-machine interaction and aesthetics.\\nFull Operational Viability: One of the prototypes will be deployed with the testing group while two are retained by the project team.\\nMass production of this meka can be achieved using the developmental experience and test data from the nine prototypes.\\n..."
