    "Relic15028_4_EN.txt": "\\nIn a bygone time which only the Jinn recall, the Lord of Flowers was cast aside by the heavens.\\nHer magnificent vessel was left a savaged husk, her kinsfolk punished by way of being stripped of their minds...\\n\\nLegend has it that the Lord of Flowers wandered the barren wastes for seventy-two nights...\\nHer heels were worn through by the merciless gravel. Her wounds gushed into limpid springs, turning into streams with no boundaries.\\nThence, those streams flowed into verdant gardens, from which sprouted night-blue water lilies.\\nWater lilies are the mothers of the Jinn, and the Jinn were birthed from intoxicating dreams and the bitter memories of loss.\\n\\nThe first Jinn were creatures of wisdom. They indulged in innocent dreams and love just as sweet.\\nTo thank their creator, the infantile Jinn took their mistress by the arm and granted her a laurel wreath of wild chrysanthemums. \\n\\n\"Oh, Lord of Flowers, master of the garden, we beg of thee — stay, leave us not!\"\\n\"Yes. Please, dream-mother, mistress of forgetting and wine, we beg of you — remain queen of this garden.\"\\n\\nAs so, detained by the gentleness of the Jinn, the exiled goddess remained in this garden of flowers.\\nGorgeous purple flowers bearing semblance to the moon bloomed wherever she stopped by. They were named \"Padisarah.\"\\n"
