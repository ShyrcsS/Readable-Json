A routine that the body and mind are accustomed to.\\nAn item will appear to replace something you lost, which will bring you great happiness.\\nRelations with the acquaintances you see most frequently will improve, and some may even become the best of friends.\\nEven the most ordinary of days can become a treasured memory.\\n\\nYour lucky object for the day: Shining Crystal Core\\nCrystalflies are tiny life-forms born of coalesced elemental energy.\\nAnd the elements are blessings promised by the world to the people who inhabit it."
