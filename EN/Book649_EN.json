    "Book649_EN.txt": "Once, in a dream, I saw a black ship.\\nIt sailed through dark night and bleak fog.\\nThe hull was rotten, the mast shattered,\\nYet in some perverse jest at human rationality,\\nEach broken piece had been placed in some twisted way,\\nEntwined together by the algae and seaweed that enveloped the vessel,\\nForming a dreadful dark shadow that shambled through the moonlight,\\nThat none could glimpse and not panic.\\nShift your gaze just a little, and in an instant,\\nIt shall appear again before you.\\nA tall and slim figure standing upon the deck,\\nWrapped in dark robes, its face barely seen.\\nOnly its eyes, those two cold eyes,\\nWhich can pierce your soul with a glance.\\nWas that a monster that arose from the depths of the seas?\\nA lord returned from some ancient world?\\nOr perhaps the nightmare itself?"
