We guard this palace.\\nJust as we followed Euergetia to pacify the northern barbarian border, and deliver unto them civilization.\\nWe choose civilization and death. There is no greater honor than to die defending civilization.\\nPlay, comrades, play the grand verse! For all that is noble and glorious, and in the name of our benefactrix.</center>"
