    "Weapon11405_EN.txt": "\\nRumored to be a legendary sword of Liyue.\\nIt was said its sheath was made with eaglewood, decorated with mica, and engraved with the imagery of war.\\nThis priceless sheath, however, was lost.\\nTo the blade, the sheath was its prison, keeping it from its true purpose.\\nThe blade is so sharp that its victims would only realize they had been struck an hour later.\\n\\nIt is said that Kunwu forged this prized sharp sword in just one day, though he worked all day and all night to do so.\\nBut when Kunwu's aged master saw his apprentice's work, he clenched his fists, sighed in anguish, and beat the ground with his staff.\\n\"O, pitiful is this thing most merciless in all the world.\"\\nThe master let out a final, long sigh, and hobbled away.\\n\\nKunwu pondered his master's words for three days, and did not touch a single blade in that time.\\nThen, he spent a whole year painstakingly carving an eaglewood sheath.\\n\\nKunwu thought that an elegant and opulent scabbard would surely suffice to subdue the wildness and violence of the blade.\\nBut then the prized sword was lost among the common folk. The sharp blade survived, but all that remained of the scabbard was its story.\\nFor the sharp blade seeks only to bathe in the blood of its victims, and no sheath can be made that will curb this desire.\\n"
