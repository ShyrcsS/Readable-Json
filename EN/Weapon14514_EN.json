The man who had lived for many years in the shadows\\nHeld the light he once saw in his heart as he quietly slumbered beneath the soil by the breach.\\n\\nThe flood that would wash everything away is never unleashed,\\nAs fate is often loath to grant would-be heroes an honorable death.\\nEven so, an inaudible trickle began to silently corrode the priory as if a thief shrouded in the shadows.\\nThose forced to join the order and live underwater gradually increased in number,\\nYet those who swore the oath, understood its meaning, and knew the teachings only declined over time.\\nMany long years later, a grand and ominous fortress would rise from the seabed,\\nBut as for the last brother who called himself a watcher and shouldered the expectations of a god,\\nThe location of his grave would become known to none.\\n\\nStill, perhaps this place can still be called fortunate,\\nAs the other suppressed breach was eventually discovered many years later by one who set out to reveal its secrets."
