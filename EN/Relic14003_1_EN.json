Wisdom flowed from within.\\n\\nThe Lavawalker would toy with the goblet. Even in the blazing heat, it remained intact.\\nLegend has it that the Lavawalker would drink lava from this goblet as if it were a glass of fine wine.\\nBut while fine wine evaporates in high heat, the wisdom of the sage could withstand a trial by fire.\\n\\nTo the Lavawalker, fine wine was merely a catalyst in the process of producing ingenuity.\\nAided by alcohol, even the slightest spark can combust into a brilliant idea.\\n\\nThe goblet was a silent witness to the forging of wisdom amidst the flames.\\nThe moment before the Lavawalker set off on his final journey was when the goblet was filled with the most pride.\\n"
