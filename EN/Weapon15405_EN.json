    "Weapon15405_EN.txt": "\\nAn ancient bow, as hard as cast iron, that once belonged to a famed archer.\\nHe once slayed monsters and bandits like silvergrass in the wind.\\nAs he pursued mastery in the discipline of archery,\\nhis string sang like unrelenting thunder,\\nand his arrows shone like sun-soaked iron rain.\\n\\nIn his twilight years, the archer had a revelation.\\n\"The ultimate profundity of speech is the word withheld, and the ultimate profundity in archery is the arrow spared.\"\\n\\nThereafter, he never spoke again of arrows shot out of the sky.\\nNor did he speak again of the foul monsters slain by iron arrows shot from an iron bow.\\n\\nHe buried his bow in the ground and went to live as a hermit amidst the hills.\\n\\nAllegedly, the story of his death is as follows:\\nEvery night, as the sound of a plucked string rang out from his home, a ray of brilliant purple light shot forth, and foul monsters dared not approach.\\nOn the night of his death there was a storm. Amidst the howling wind and rain there was but a single clap of thunder. The accompanying bolt of lightning shot upwards, towards the sky, burning bright as the stars in the galaxy.\\n"
