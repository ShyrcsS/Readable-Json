    "Relic15042_5_EN.txt": "\\nThat was a time when frost's gentle light had long shattered like a silver mirror, but when the new moon had yet to rise.\\nIt was then that the great plan, carried through countless generations since the time of extinction, was on the verge of culmination.\\n\\nThe bloodline, purified for over a thousand years, would at last give birth to the chosen one destined to reign over Elysium.\\nThe false sevenfold radiance of the high heavens would fall at her feet, and the bones of the earth would rise to follow her.\\nFor from her would spring union with the world, and from her would the first great cause be rebuilt.\\nThat was the sacrosanct duty that had been passed down to the daughters of the far north. So it should have been.
