    "Relic15041_1_EN.txt": "\\nIn the rotating galleries of Zapolyarny Palace, the banquets and dances never seemed to stop.\\nThe fae nobles, fond of luxury, considered attending banquets their most important duty.\\nEven the hardest heart could be softened by the rich aroma of fine wine...\\nAnd many important affairs of state, both great and small, were often decided by those in a slight tipsy haze.\\n \\nProfessor Rotwang, whom the nobles called the \"mad monk\" in private, had attended court rather frequently of late.\\nThis was not just because he had become the Tsar's favorite through his mastery of alchemy and astrology,\\nNor simply because he constantly uttered profound aphorisms that inevitably sent everyone in the room into laughter.\\nWhat truly made the nobles sit up and take notice was the legends surrounding him.\\n \\nIt was said that the Grand Duke Photius once, out of envy, sought to get rid of this troublesome viper.\\nHe replaced the fine fire-water with a deadly poison... But to his astonishment, the good professor appeared completely unaffected after drinking it.\\nIn the end, the grand duke himself took a knee to the monk, even becoming the latter's most devoted follower.\\n \\nAnother tale had it that Filipov, the most adept of the fae at the art of transformation, once publicly called the professor's research nothing more than an elaborate hoax.\\nThe mad monk responded to the accusation with naught but a calm smile. Then, before everyone's eyes, he summoned the soul of Filipov's late wife, who had been appearing in the bereaved fae's dreams.\\nThese tales became a favorite topic of chatter at banquets. But whenever someone tried to confirm their truth, the professor remained silent.\\nPerhaps no one truly cared whether these stories were true. Maybe they only existed to entertain banquet guests between songs and dances.\\n \\nOr perhaps, to the nobles, an outlander with no local ties was more worthy of their trust.\\nOf course, it would be even better if he could assist them with a few niggles.\\nBut how could mere actors in this drama have foreseen the tragic denouement's coming?"
