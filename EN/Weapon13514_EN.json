They would surely grow dejected at poor fare.\\nAnd even the most valiant general could not escape the myriad miscellaneous matters that came with supporting the troops, such that glorious victory might continue to be won.\\n\\nThe God King's directives were the supreme rule, not to be doubted or disobeyed. Yet, neither should the weakness of those who decayed all too quickly be dismissed.\\nAnd since the harmonious, glorious symphony was meant to embrace all living beings on the High Sea, fulfilling their tiny wish was no offense.\\nHer golden-haired colleague, born of barbarian stock, would again grumble about her neglect behind her back, but as always, would never stop her.\\nAn exalted Harmost's will could shake the very bones of the earth themselves.
