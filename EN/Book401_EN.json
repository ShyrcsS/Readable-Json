As I expected, most of the content concerned forging techniques as well as tricks on how to handle certain ores.\\nThe tail end featured a number of hand-drawn drafts, mostly bonsai designs. Well, I suppose this love for them does count as a clan tradition.\\nMy son turns six this year. His name is \"Kazuha,\" just as my wife wished.\\n...\\nHis coming and her going were not far apart. To think that it has been six years since then... If she were still here, she would surely be helping my father in the yard.\\nMy father lived well in his younger years, and that lifestyle has greatly deteriorated in his latter ones. It fills me with shame to admit that I am unable to improve these circumstances.\\nHe says that it is not important, however, and that it is instead we who are young who are the key."
