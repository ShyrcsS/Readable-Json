I guess you're Plum out of luck now, huh?\\nBut don't worry, I made a big ruckus in the Order of the Fruit in your defense. They may have kicked me out over it, but I've got no regrets. I only hope your soul can rest in peace.\\nNo one else knows this, but I've also put lots of Bulle Fruits in my new home to remember you by.\\nLooks like only four of the Five Great Operatives of the Order of the Fruit now remain."
