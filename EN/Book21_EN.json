Bless our King! As long as he reigns over us, we will never starve!\"\\n\"Oink, oink! Bless the gentle Anemo Archon for giving our King such a kind and polite Princess!\"\\n\\n(There are some words in the margin written in tiny handwriting: \"dada, if I dont eat candy efery night, and i pray eferyday, will i turn into a wild piggy? i want to be a wild piggy because they are so tasty\")"
