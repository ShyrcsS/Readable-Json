Are we even friends anymore?\\nToday, I'm making sure you get yours. Let's see how you like this trial of strength!\\nYou owe us. You learned to lie thanks to us (that's what {NICKNAME} and Paimon said), so show some gratitude.\\nOn the other hand, I suppose I should also thank you lot. I don't think I hate liars as much as I did before spending time with you.\\nJust as you said — liars come in all forms.\\nPeople lie for the sake of face, children, family, and gain, to comfort others, to protect others...\\nTangled lies weave the great web in which people live their lives, right?\\nStill, I don't think Dr. Mosso was right when he said that \"a curve is the shortest distance between two people.\"\\nThere are definitely some times when you should just shoot your shot straight.\\nFor example, I miss you."
