    "Book1064_EN.txt": "To the Honorary Knight, {NICKNAME}:\\nHey there, I'm Varka. (If that doesn't ring a bell, I'm the Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius.)\\nI've heard a lot about you. Jean's always singing your praises. For all the good you've done for Mondstadt, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.\\nIt's a real shame that I'm away on an expedition and haven't had the good fortune of crossing paths with you.\\nBut it seems that fortune's about to smile on me real soon.\\nYou might've heard that we've finally settled down in Nod-Krai (well, half-settled). The factions here are quite the tangled mess and a real devil to navigate, but no hardship's ever stalled the north wind.\\nI've met a few reliable companions, and I'm planning to introduce you to them. One of them is the messenger right in front of you. I'm sure you two'll be fast friends.\\nAs for enemies, well, they're everywhere. We've got the Abyss Order and the Fatui, not to mention loyalties at risk of flip-flopping at a moment's notice. Given your experience, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.\\nAnyway, now that I can see the bottom of my mug, I'm going to stop here — these words will likely be as dull to read as they were to write. Instead, let's talk more over a glass of wine sometime.\\nSee you in Nod-Krai.\\nVarka\\nP.S. If you're really heading over, you'd best lace up your boots. It's a world apart compared to Mondstadt.\\nP.P.S. I forgot the most important thing! Once you're in Nod-Krai, come look for me at \"The Flagship,\" it's a tavern. I'll look out for you — as a Grand Master should for his Honorary Knight, am I right?"
