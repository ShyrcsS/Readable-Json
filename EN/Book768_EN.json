But nobody has given me any medicine.\\nI suppose I am more fortunate than Crecy... the pain keeps her awake all night.\\nI suppose they think that anything goes so long as the experimental subjects can be used up before they die...\\nIt is so damp here. I have given her my blanket.\\nSo cold, so cold. So cold.\\nAs long as one persists, all things will pass.\\nThere will be a reward for hard work.\\nI like to tell them such things.\\nBut it is I who am losing my grip."
