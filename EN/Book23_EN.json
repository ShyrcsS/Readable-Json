    "Book23_EN.txt": "The pup was a carefree child who had bright blue eyes and slick gray fur.\\nWhen he got angry, he looked exactly like the wolf head relief atop the Mondstadt Cathedral.\\nBut one day, when he was hunting in the forest, he ran into the evil squirrel sorcerer: Woobakwa!\\nOf all the beings in the ancient world, none were more evil than Woobakwa — not even demons and dragons. Woobakwa despised everything nice, and swore to transform beauty into ugliness and turn light into dark.\\nAt the sight of the joyful wolf, anger boiled inside him. He cursed:\\n\"Squeak! Squeak! Angry am I! I shall spike his heart with the coldest ice, and he will never again know the meaning of hope!\"\\nWith that said, Woobakwa began to curse the pup with his magic.\\nBut the rash pup gobbled him up, just like that, without the slightest warning.\\nWoobakwa was so furious that he cursed the pup using the most foul and insulting words ever uttered by a squirrel. The pup felt the noise coming from his mouth, and only then did he realize his mistake.\\n\"Aroo, I'm so sorry, mister squirrel, I thought you were edible!\"\\nThe pup wished to apologize to the squirrel, but he felt his throat tighten and then loosen. The squirrel slid down to his stomach with a gulp.\\n\\n(A sheet of paper bearing fine handwriting is taped to this page: \"Lily, this is why you should eat cautiously when you're outside.\")"
