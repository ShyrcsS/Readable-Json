    "Book241_EN.txt": "Continuing where we left off, Black Fox Itaru successfully tamed the bandit duo, the Twin Oni of Tokaku, and the three set off on their new journey of chivalry.\\n\\nAs the chivalric trio was resting in Konda Village, they ran into a mother and her daughter.\\nAfter striking up a conversation, they learned that the mother's surname was Youzan, the daughter's given name was Yui, and that both were musicians from the distant Seirai Island visiting Inazuma City to join in the festival. On their way, they had been scammed by a Lavender Melon seller from the village: He had offered them a few melons to quench their thirst, ostensibly out of the goodness of his heart, before then insisting that they purchase more of his melons at an extortionate price. But touring musicians aren't exactly wealthy, and they couldn't afford to spend the entirety of their budget for the return trip on overpriced melons...\\nThe Twin Oni of Tokaku are an impulsive pair. Upon hearing the story, they instantly began fuming with rage, and unanimously decided that they needed to teach this dishonest merchant a lesson by cutting him into tiny pieces. But Black Fox Itaru had another idea, and spoke up to stop the two sisters:\\n\\n\"Enough. I know what to do.\"\\n\\nShe comforted the mother and daughter:\\n\\n\"You two have nothing to worry about. Just watch, I'll talk to the merchant, and he'll come to his senses.\"\\n\\nItaru marched off to look for the dishonest merchant."
