The meeting point will be decided when the time comes. This life-form may not be visible to the naked eye. If possible, please ask young children to talk to it, and use the opportunity to catch it. Protect it, if necessary.\\nPlease protect this dried flower. It may be the key to communicating with the creature know as the 'Aranara.'\\nYou may grumble that this is ridiculous and boring. But before you do that, please think about completing a commission that Agha Farrokh's daughter has personally entrusted to you...\\n...And of the rewards and reputation you'll gain from completing it.\\n\\n— Siman Farrokhzad"
