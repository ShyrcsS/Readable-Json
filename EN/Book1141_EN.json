    "Book1141_EN.txt": "...\\nA parent's love for their child is the purest in this world.\\nBut when the very blood ties that should bind a family are instead used as a snare of coercion,\\nEven the most unshakeable resolve will break under the weight of fear and worry.\\nMaking other people's closest relatives pawns in political ploys...\\nThis is tantamount to tarnishing the sacred blessings the gods gave humankind.\\nThis is the first of his three great sins.\\n...\\nWith a stone pillar as its seal, and a spell as its covering,\\nLet the evidence of the Serpent of All Evils' crimes be preserved beneath the moonlight."
