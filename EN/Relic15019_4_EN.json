    "Relic15019_4_EN.txt": "\\nAn omamori crafted using an art known as Mizuhiki.\\nIt is said to have the power to bind wishes and the reasons for those wishes within itself.\\n\\nOnce, I learned how to manage the affairs of the shrine under the tutelage of a mighty kitsune.\\nBack then, I was just a young shrine maiden who had just arrived on Narukami from a small fishing village.\\nI was duller than a teapot and had yet to lose the obstinate impulsiveness and curiosity of a child,\\nI was always naively skeptical of the elegant but incomprehensible words of Lady Saiguu.\\n\\n\"Everything in the world is entangled. Hence, illusory visions were born out of concrete reality.\"\\n\"The so-called omamori cannot make one's wishes come true at all, but they can make them eternal through this entanglement.\"\\n\\nSeeing my befuddled expression, a picture of complete confusion, Lady Kitsune couldn't help bursting into laughter,\\nShe cheerfully knocked my head with her pipe and sneakily changed the subject.\\n\\n\"I suppose you've met your fated one as well, Hibiki?\"\\n\\n\"What sort of 'fate' could there be with a rude and reckless brute like that!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, is that so?\"\\n\\nBut darkness engulfed everything in the end.\\nThat \"fate,\" too, was no more."
