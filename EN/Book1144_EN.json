Now, I'm the only one left...\\nAh, and this wolf... the one that came with us from Mondstadt...\\nMaster went off, tracking the monsters. I cannot say if he will return...\\nBut it doesn't matter now. Where he goes, I can't follow, drenched in blood as I am...\\nThe end of this path of chivalry... Only he and these crows drawn by the scent of blood will see it.\\nI won't leave my body to them...\\nWell, wolf from my homeland... Consider sending me on my way your final duty."
