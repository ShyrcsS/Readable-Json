When night came, they would leave the pearl-colored palace to roam the desert, and Nilotpala Lotuses would bloom at their feet.\\n\\n...\\nUltimately, two moon-wheels shattered into dust and disappeared. The last of the sisters was so overcome with sorrow that she would never leave her palace again.\\nAfter a long time, the moon debris finally fell to the earth. At that time, the god of vegetation had already brought the forest to the desert lands.\\nWhere the dust of the moon fell, the Nilotpala Lotuses bloom. And those children who breathe in the dust will have a pearl-like moon in their hearts.\\nThis is why there are always children who are confused by the moon, and the reason why the Nilotpala Lotus blossoms every night, and why the moon always favors these children.\\nBecause the three sisters, who mirror each other, long to be reunited.\\n\\nThe Nilotpala Lotus withered after telling this story. She had waited long — long enough for the desert to become a jungle, and for the great race to be dethroned,\\nLong enough for us to appear on the earth, and for the Aranara who told me this story to appear before her and speak to her.\\nThat Aranara lost many, many more memories time and time again, until Vanarana was destroyed and we entered a dream.\\nBut that is just as well, for the story of the moon will grow into a pearly moon in our hearts as well as yours.\\n\\nChildren fascinated by the moon will weep when they gaze upon it, for the moon has turned into fine sand and entered their eyes.\\nIn countless tales, not a single tear will be in vain."
