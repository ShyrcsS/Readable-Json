    "Relic15022_5_EN.txt": "\\nTime seems to pass exceedingly slowly in the silent, fluorescent ocean depths.\\nEven the bright seashells might grow forgetful as the years lengthen.\\n\\nThe people of Watatsumi once came forth from the darkness, and thus bade farewell to the long dreams of the deep.\\nThey escaped the prying gaze of the Dragonheirs in the dark, walking the glimmering coral stair into the realm of daylight.\\nIt is said that at that time, the ocean people would take a single seashell as remembrance for their clan.\\nAnd as for those who had lost theirs, they would be welcomed into a new family.\\n\\nIn the ancient tongue, these pure shells would become known as the Parcels of Reunion.\\nTwo parties who embrace shall not again be parted by an outside force, though this enjoining is not itself eternal.\\nThese seashells, therefore, were a farewell to life beneath the waves, and the beginning of a new life under the sun."
