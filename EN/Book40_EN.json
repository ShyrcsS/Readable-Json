    "Book40_EN.txt": "—Yaoguang Shoal—\\nThis is the delta of the Bishui River, where the sand and mud carried by the river has accumulated into an open and flat shoal. When I finally arrived, the shoal was shrouded in a blanket of fog, and my new shoes were soaked again. I heard the sound of some unknown monsters coming from the fog, but couldn't quite tell their exact location.\\nAll that was left to do was set up the tent and wait for this blasted fog to drift away.\\nWhen I was staying at the Wangshu Inn, a merchant told me about the legends of Yaoguang Shoal. He started with a poem — \"Jade-lustered waves washed into the ocean while a conch lay empty on the white shoal.\"\\nThe meaning of the poem is that the sunlight, pure as jade, glimmers on the surface of the Bishui River and seems to flow into the sea along with the river water. But the Greenconch Lodge on the Yaoguang Shoal has been unoccupied for some time.\\nI once ventured into the fog to visit the Seashell Sanctuary, but didn't see the owner.\\nA legend among fishermen has it that the Greenconch Lodge was the home of an adeptus — the green conch itself, in fact, constituting part of her very being. She provided shelter for travelers who were lost in the fog, took care of the shipwrecked survivors, and bid godspeed to other adepti on crusades against sea monsters.\\nBut older fishermen interpret the legend differently. They say that the Seashell Sanctuary was not the abode of an adeptus, but of a family that had lived in the giant seashell for generations. They devoted themselves to helping the lost and saved many fishermen's lives.\\nIt seems the fog is drifting away and the sun is almost visible now.\\nNext up, I'll borrow a boat to get to Guyun Stone Forest and visit the ruins where the Geo Archon vanquished the sea monster.\\nI should arrive in no time at all if the weather is good."
