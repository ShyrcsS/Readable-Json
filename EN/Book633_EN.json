They knocked our night sentries out, and attacked the camp under cover of darkness...\\n...Those thugs destroyed all of our academic findings, and plundered our food, water, and Sumpter Beasts. They say this is our punishment for harboring a felon — a mercenary named Narvash. If we don't turn him over, they won't ask again...\\n...But Narvash is gone. Perhaps he escaped in the chaos, or is hiding somewhere. Either way, he's not in our camp...\\n...\\n...It's absurd. Narvash is a crippled old blind man who can't even speak clearly, and we're supposed to believe that he's some dangerous murderer?\\n...\\n...Captain Parshid's wound continues to worsen and is now showing signs of festering and necrosis. It must be the venom of the Consecrated Scorpion. Just a tiny bit is sufficient to paralyze most people for a week, and it is lethal if concentrated... Our stock of antivenom for this fearful toxin has been depleted to nothing. Those Nagarjunites must've nicked it during their raid a few days ago — they stole almost half of all our medicines. Looks like we have no choice but to turn back as soon as possible.\\nBut our first priority is to smooth things out with the Nagarjunites. If not, we'll have no way out..."
