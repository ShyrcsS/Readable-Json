    "Book258_EN.txt": "To my beloved son, Zushi Chouji\\n\\nIf you're reading this letter, I hope you can forgive me.\\nLeaving you makes my heart ache, but I have no other choice.\\nPlease do not give up on hope in life or in me... Just as we've never once given up hope that your father, my husband, is alive.\\nThe Tatarigami presence on the island is very dangerous, so please take good care of yourself.\\nWith the Tatarigami's destruction, the war should soon come to an end. When that time comes, the two warring sides will probably lay down their arms and initiate a joint effort to clean up the corruption on this island.\\nIt's just too bad that I most likely won't be there to see it happen.\\n\\nYou may run into many people who want to take advantage of you or hurt you in the days to come. But do not stop believing in others because of this. There are always more good than bad people out there.\\nEverything will get better once this war ends.\\nBut please, please do not follow my footsteps or rush to meet me. This is something that I am asking of you as your mother.\\nPlease keep believing and continue to hold out hope for my return.\\nI will be back, and I will personally apologize to both you and your father.\\nPlease wait for the coming of that day.\\n"
