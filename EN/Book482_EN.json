    "Book482_EN.txt": "(This obelisk was buried deep underground, and so its inscription is very well-preserved.)\\nPraise Badanah our king, for before him even the myriad schemes of Muzzudin appear to be but folly!\\nHis virtues are above the other rulers, and besides food and drink he desires nothing.\\nHis bloodline is noble and pure, and his father is most beloved of the Verdant Lord.\\nHis mighty hand stretches out and subdues the sands, and the claws of his hunting eagles are like swords and spears.\\nHis brothers are befuddled and feeble, and so shall the ninety-nine kingdoms fall under one ruler once more.\\nCome then, raise your glasses!\\nLet the refreshing wine reflect our king's glorious visage, and let the balms from afar send forth their fragrance.\\nEven should the sandstorms invade the oases, and the trees wither forever,\\nOur king shall rule forever, golden crown'd, and to the ends of the earth shall his great name ring."
