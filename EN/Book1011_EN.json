    "Book1011_EN.txt": "Tanya, I have heard that you wish to return to the homeland for a family reunion — a reasonable request, in my estimation.\\nYou have been here in Natlan for quite some years now, in any case, and it is hardly proper that you remain a Praporshchik after all this. A promotion should be considered.\\nHowever, while you have done your fair share, more may still be required.\\nAs such, I have arranged for you to take over the duty of guarding Madam Kovalevskaya. It would be well if you made the best of this opportunity.\\nOf course, do not feel too pressured by this assignment. The situation is urgent, and the sea route perilous, while the dispatched vessel is quite old. No one could blame you for any mishaps that might occur during such a journey.\\nBeing blameless, therefore, you should do as you see fit. You have my backing, as surely as I have someone else's. I'm sure you can appreciate my meaning.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, I visited your family recently.\\nI've arranged for them to be taken care of, and they are doing well. In the meantime, simply focus on doing your duty.\\n\\nYou have disappointed me quite a few times already. See that you seize this final chance you have been given."
