Well... as you all know, I'm probably the last person you'd think of when it comes to guiding others. I still have a long way to go, and I'm still trying to figure out how to peacefully coexist with everything in this world.\\n\\nBut if you're asking me about who can be of help, my friend Fischl and her friend Mona the astrologist are both very knowledgeable and brave. I'd say they're probably the ones you're looking for.\\n\\nAnd that's my answer! Wishing you all good luck!\\n\\n<right>Bennett</right>"
