Behind him was a large,\\nbright moon.\\n\\nHe shouted out the names of everyone\\nin the village. The Village Chief\\nwas first to be named, and so frightened\\nwas he that he wished\\nto climb up the haystack\\nAnd stop up Francois's mouth.\\n\"Are you crazy!? You're yelling so loudly\\nthe dragon might show up!\"\\n\"You good-for-nothing!\\nHave you not seen how the windmill\\neveryone built has been destroyed\\nby the dragon!?\\nAnd here you are,\\nworrying if it'll return!?\" Francois\\nreally would have loved to kick him off\\nthe haystack, but held back\\ngiven that the Chief, too,\\nwas worried for the villagers'\\nsafety.\\nFrancois saw that nigh all\\nthe villagers had arrived,\\nand so he cleared his throat.\\n\"Dear neighbors and kin,\\nthink you still that we must endure this?\"\\n\"No, of course not, but we cannot\\ndo anything about the dragon,\"\\nsaid the grocer.\\n\"Who says so?
