    "Book85_EN.txt": "One day, at the crack of dawn,\\nA dancer whose sword was her song set foot in Mondstadt.\\nThough clad in chains with cuffed hands and fettered feet,\\nIn her silence lay a song:\\nIt was the song of freedom. A song of a brighter dawn beyond the walls,\\nA joyous ballad sung without reservation by a people unrestrained.\\n\\nShe was the dawnlight of the Wanderer's Troupe,\\nBut she spelled eternal midnight for the Aristocracy.\\nI once asked her, \"Why do you come to overthrow our aristocrats?\"\\n\"Do you not know that they are the first among us?\"\\n\\n\"Wherefore do you place their lives on a pedestal?\"\\nCame her voice, like a fresh breeze,\\n\"If you claim to know the wind as your companion,\"\\n\"Then did you not once know freedom, too?\"\\n\\nTo her lonesome listeners she told a tale:\\nA tale of our rulers' better ancestors who held divine power,\\nA tale of angels, gods and vile dragons,\\nA tale of the deities and peoples of all the land.\\nEach myth and legend she turned to song,\\nAnd the wind carried the song to all corners of the land.\\n\\nIn the aristocrats' arena, her sword sang once more:\\nHer final masterpiece, but it stopped short of perfection.\\nA nameless knight retrieved her sword from the blood-soaked battlefield,\\nAnd buried it where the gentle winds meet in communion."
