    "Relic15032_1_EN.txt": "\\nThe peaceful sea surged, sending the ship sliding between the silent manor and the temple.\\nUnder the pale moonlight, the golden dome that had seemed so glorious in the daytime lost its luster.\\n\\nThe God King awoke with a start from his majestic dream. The clear starlight had fled.\\nViolence and estrangement formed a darkness deeper than darkness, shrouding the great dome.\\nIn terror and remorse did he summon to him his most loyal guards and most attuned musicians,\\nAnd he gave them his final orders, intending to bring peace back to the fractured lands...\\n\\nYet, just as a flood unleashed cannot be held back, the deeply ingrained arrogance and prejudice could not be reversed in a night, and crushed the Harmosts and rulers...\\nAll the noble sacrifices, all the unselfish plans — all fell to ruin at the hands of the wicked, and all came crashing down in the end.\\nWhether the barbaric armies of the Fell Dragon Prince, or the God King determined to the last to save the empire,\\nThey were swept away by an inexorable storm — even the luxurious palace and the jade-green manor were consigned to destruction together...\\nWithout the guiding golden song, the once-noble people of the glorious kingdom transformed into disfigured golems...\\n\\nWhen the final cacophony of the golden night faded to calm, the Harmost Boethius lay amidst the rubble,\\nOnly the rubble heard his insensate mumblings, and only the debris recorded the sin of treachery...\\n\\n\"In a moment of madness, he betrayed us all.\"\\n\"Order will not easily change, nor will human regrets.\""
