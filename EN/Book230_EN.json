    "Book230_EN.txt": "—Great Fortune—\\nWhenever you draw your blade, it shall lead you towards victory. The shine of your blade as it leaves its sheath will also inspire those around you.\\nToday, a single shot from your bow will shoot down an airborne prey, and a single strike against a guard will hit their weak spot.\\nIf you have no target, try looking around. You might find a surprise waiting for you.\\nAlso, don't forget to share your good luck with your less-fortunate companions.\\n\\nYour lucky object for the day: Rare Horsetail\\nHorsetails grow in fields of Silvergrass, but are much taller.\\nIt is a fitting symbol for you, who stands tall and proud in this world."
