At the bottom of the folded note are two new lines Aurelie has written, in handwriting much more legible than before. But it seems that they took her both great effort and a great deal of time to write.)\\n\\nIf you become human...\\nYou can reveal your secret to no one. You will face suffering and loneliness.\\nIs this truly what you want?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBecause I am an older sister to them.\\nI love them."
