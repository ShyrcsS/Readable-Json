The Wolf followed his scent into battle.\\nStill one were they, the Wolf and the Knight.\\n\\nThough one they were, death comes for beasts sooner than men.\\nLaying down his sword as a gravestone, the Knight of Boreas buried the Wolf in the remote countryside.\\nThe Knight of Boreas then left the city behind, living instead the wandering life of a lone wolf.\\n\\nYet the eternal wolf spirit remained here,\\nWatching over the land the Knight once protected.\\n"
