It was a gift from the champion gladiator's master.\\nFrom this goblet the champion gladiator drank, be it fine wine or the blood of the defeated.\\n\\nAnother victory for the gladiator. Covered in wounds, he dedicated the victory to his master.\\nMore intoxicating and pain numbing than the fine wine was the victory, honor, and applause from the crowd. \\n\\nThe master allowed him to join the feast and presented him with this goblet.\\nIt was an exquisite goblet, made specially for him. A symbol of how much his master cared.\\nBut the golden chains of vanity had bound the gladiator and the poisonous snake of desire had strangled him.\\nBy pausing to wait for the wine of victory, the gladiator missed his chance to seize a fleeting chance at freedom.\\n"
