After the gloom, we are reborn beneath the spring sun.\"\\n\"Should the winds one day rage anew, and a tyrant seek to torment mortals again,\"\\n\"We shall not hesitate to stain the bright blossoms with blood, even if it means turning our backs on the divine throne once more.\"\\n\"If the winds remain ever gentle, and the heavens look kindly upon our realm,\"\\n\"We shall guard the song of Mondstadt without faltering, as the new winds once bestowed upon us their sheltering grace.\"\\n\\n\"In the name of Great Arcadia's descendants, thus do we crown the newborn god with the thousand winds.\"\\n\"May your words be as those of our former lord, until the faith of all beings becomes one with poetry.\"\\n\"May your deeds be as those of our former lord, until our former lord acts as you do.\""
