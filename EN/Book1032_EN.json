Something from beyond, our shadowy bane...\\n\\n...Time is running low. Before all things terminate, I must find a new path for my people... A path forever lit and free from the darkness of shadows...\\n\\n...Even if no glorious end awaits... If I shall be swallowed by shadows, ravaged by flame... It matters not...\\n\\n...But how can I forsake... the future of my kin...\\n"
