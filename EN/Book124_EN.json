Never again would the fractured moon become whole.\\nThe spring fairy suddenly realized that though she had found a place to belong, and though she had experienced fleeting happiness, she was still alone.\\n\\nThe boy, now no longer a boy, could not perceive her flight, and blamed himself for his own solitude.\\n\"Perhaps she was merely a childish fantasy.\"\\nHe would think this to himself as he listened to the gurgling of the spring.\\n\\nBut that cool kiss was real, as was the wind that once played with her hair.\\nSuddenly, he realized that though he had met and parted with countless new friends, and though he had adventured and returned more times than he could remember, he was still alone in the end.\\n\\nSo, as they had done many years ago, the boy's tears fell into the pure pond, soaking into the fractured moon.\\nBut this time, the spring fairy did not come as promised.\\nStubbornly she turned her back, willing to be the object of an innocent childhood dream, to be a fleeting guest wandering from a foreign land, but unwilling to allow her near-eternal life to break her lover's promise.\\n\\nLegend has it that whenever the rain pours down, the raindrops that fall into the pond mix with the tears of the spring fairy.\\nTo his dying day, the boy believed wholeheartedly in this groundless superstition.\\nBut sadly, the spring fairy who fled from her true feelings could never believe it herself.\\n"
