Flowing within it is not sand, but tiny Electro shards.\\nThe shards shatter and flow down as time passes, then merge together at the bottom of the hourglass.\\n\\nThe Thundersoother who defeated the Beast of Thunder crafted this hourglass from amethyst.\\nThe passage of time is just like lightning. It bursts through the sky and is gone in a flash.\\nEven the Thundersoother could not conquer the flash of time.\\n\\nWithin this hourglass, even thunder and lightning have to obey the never-changing law of time.\\nIn the hourglass, the shards shatter and merge countless times while time silently flashes by.\\nObserving this taught the Thundersoother about the cycle of life and death. Empowered with this knowledge, he was able to defeat the beast.\\n"
