You may be about to lose something that you treasure.\\nRemember to rest if you're feeling unwell.\\nThink twice before you make a decision.\\n\\nYour lucky object for the day: Frosty Mist Flower\\nThe Mist Flower gives off a coldness that says: I am unapproachable.\\nBut sometimes, that same cool air can calm one's heart and mind.\\nThis may help you to judge situations correctly, and act wisely."
