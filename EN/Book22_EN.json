    "Book22_EN.txt": "North of the boar forest was a frozen tundra.\\nThe playful Barbatos had not reached those lands, so they remained covered by ice and snow.\\nEvery creature who ventured there risked freezing their paws and hooves off.\\n\"It's cold, too cold! It's freezing! My claws are going to shatter!\"\\nEven the bravest, strongest Boar King could not withstand the frigid tundra.\\n\"Oink, oink, oink! My frozen snout is turning purple!\"\\nThere lived but a single lone wolf pup in that place.\\n\\n(The childish handwriting at the bottom of the page reads: \"dada, why does the little doggy have paws that don't freeze off in the cold?\")"
