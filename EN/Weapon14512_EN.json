On this night, the stars and lilies belong only to you.\"\\n\"Keep my name in your heart, dearest Xiphos, if but only for this night.\"\\n\\nTo please the waning vassal king, the scholars who ruled Tulaytullah offered tribute,\\nAnd Makhaira, a court dancer, found herself as part of that inventory, forced to say farewell to her golden-eyed lover.\\nThe stories that follow have been diluted by too many tongues and have been left forgotten by too many minds...\\n\\nMakhaira claimed her vengeance, bringing low a desert kingdom once thought invincible...\\nBut her own life was devoured by an adder, and she was drawn into slumber beneath quilts of gilded sand, never to wake.\\nXiphos earned esteem among his kindred, yet died in vain, protecting the nobles who feared him...\\nThe Blade of Tulaytullah met his end at the hands of another exiled princeling,\\nWhose banishment had been delivered unto him indeed by that serpent-hearted dancer, the daughter of a Jinni.\\n\\nIn the end, all people, good or evil, will find themselves ground beneath the wheels of fate,\\nAnd the sapphire city would fade, dissipating like tears beneath the scorching sun."
