    "Relic15032_5_EN.txt": "\\nThe sea breeze at dawn, rapturous and free, sings this ancient hymn—\\nTime flowed forward no longer, but returned to the past with the singer.\\n\\nAlong the waters it flowed, passing the gilded domes of the glorious kingdom,\\nOn the soft summer wind it passed through the green manor ringed by towering walls.\\nWhether aristocrats in their light ships, or barbarians brought as captives,\\nAll were intoxicated by the music of a beautiful age, immersed in the memories...\\n\\nFor this was the golden world of abundance — an era of a righteous, glorious king.\\n\\n\"I came from a puny realm on a lone isle. I was born in a hut, and I grew up in a village built of reeds and grass.\"\\n\"When the warriors in their bright mail came to my home, they announced the news of 'conquest.'\"\\n\"I was but a mere youth, and I naively followed these towering demigods to the capital.\"\\n\"It was by dint of my agile fingers and bright voice that I evaded the fate of bondage.\"\\n\"Only after the God King recognized me did I first witness the might of civilization and order.\"\\n\"Let my flesh and bone, then, be utterly changed. Let my name and tribe be forsaken. The world shall know only the name 'Boethius'!\"\\n\\nAnd thus was the child born of barbarism moved by the golden palace, and became a servant of a majestic authority.\\nLike one newborn, he worked to abandon the ancient savage customs and devoured new knowledge...\\nAll he did, he did to transform himself into a person of true honor and glory, into a part of this great civilization.\\nFor nothing else did he toil, for this was the golden world of abundance — an era of a righteous, glorious king enthroned."
