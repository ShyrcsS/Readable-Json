    "Relic15024_2_EN.txt": "\\nA very long time ago, there was no ford across the river, only a misty hillside.\\nThe owner of this mountain had yet to decide what to plant here when someone preempted them.\\n\\n\"Once this tree gets a bit larger, I'll cut its leaves down and make some tea for all of you.\"\\n\"When that time comes, we'll get Cloud Retainer and Mountain Shaper to come over...\"\\n\\n\"Seriously? You plant trees any way you like on my turf, and you have the nerve to spout such things?\"\\nBut though the young lady who was master of this mountain complained, she too could imagine the tea's fragrance.\\n\\nLater, someone would quietly tie this jade pendant to the thin branches of the small tree.\\nWhen more time had passed, the mountain's master returned, but in a changed aspect,\\nAnd sans the finger that might untie the pendant. This was a long time ago now.\\n\\nMany years later, the branches of this tree would be grafted to the other side of the river by the mortals who dwelled in the mountains.\\nThe fragrance of tea would also travel from this place, Chenyu Vale, to Liyue Harbor, and from there to many more places still.\\n\\nThere are many legends concerning the tea trees of Chenyu Vale. One of them goes like this:\\nNo matter the waters, soil, or sunlight, this sort of tree only grows lushly in Chenyu Vale.\\nThis is because it remembers the promise that old friends made in the ancient past beside the tea sapling."
