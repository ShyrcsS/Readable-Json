    "Relic15030_2_EN.txt": "\\nIn a time no one remembers, the night before the sandstorm of tragedy swept through paradise...\\nThe flowers and the trees once spoke of the mortal realms, their hopes, and their desolate future.\\nThe ones who must not be approached brought about the gray death, and the dark tide ravaged the raw river banks,\\nOnly for the newborn plants and beasts to unite with mortals and push the rolling sinister waves back.\\n\\nIn the lonesome years after she had broken off ties with the lord of the red sands, the queen of grass and trees forged Khvarena into a divine bird,\\nCharging her with the protection of two worlds, with the guardianship of the border between new birth and death.\\nThe divine bird lived amongst the pines, the cypresses and the snow-lotuses, and slumbered in dreams that recalled a time when the covenant still endured...\\nIt was only when disaster came that she awakened, and went to her inevitable doom.\\nLater, just as that person had prophesied sadly, the deathly, silent gloom would permeate the rainforest...\\nJust as that covenant fellow had warned, the tides of dark beasts swarmed forth and swept through the newly-birthed forests...\\n\\nThe former leader of the realm of water was slain amidst the upheaval, and her body was transformed into a sea of pure dew, the Amrita,\\nAnd yet even that pure sea would dry up in a desolate land destroyed by the Abyss.\\nYet the mistress of grass and trees had no time to mourn, for the mother-tree of numberless seeds needed to be nurtured...\\nTo cleanse the dark impurities and ensure the purity of the Amrita, Simurgh would shatter its divine form—\\n\\n\"All beautiful things born from the Khvarena of flowers must face their fate — to wither and fall into the mud,\"\\n\"And once they have withered, they shall be reborn, nourished by the Amrita, as beings of the flowery sea, no longer troubled by such things as 'death.'\""
