They sang of the stories that blossomed brilliantly like a field of flowers,\\nBringing courage, hope, and happiness to the children who had never had the chance to witness a dream,\\nWeaving a never-ending song of a thousand nights, lighting up the moments before the long-awaited daybreak.\\n\\nAfter traversing a thousand dreams, until the nightingale no longer sang, until the fading sun fell beneath the horizon once again,\\nThe traveler saw at journey's end that verdant lamp, that faraway homeland of old,\\nWhere the dew-covered rose still swayed softly in the moonlit breeze, waiting for her to tell a new story:\\n\"Though the memories of past nights have all but faded, we shall continue to sing songs of praise for the sweet dreams that have yet to unfold.\""
