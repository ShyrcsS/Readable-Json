I, Guy Verhaecht, am confident that one day people will compete just to read my ideation notes.\\nAll the troubles I've been dealing with are but trivial stumbling blocks along my path to success.\\nI see little promise in the youngsters at the Darshan.

On the one hand, I shall find the universal beauty that exists in the hearts of all people...\\nAnd on the other, I shall enlighten the common people with my aesthetics, paving my road to fame.\\n...\\n"
