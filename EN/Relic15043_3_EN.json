    "Relic15043_3_EN.txt": "\\nOnce there was an age when, of the three silver wheels that guided the primal heavens, two had fallen.\\nThe world, no longer sheltered by \"Eternity,\" marched toward its final breath, awaiting the return of the New Moon...\\n\\nWhen the \"Eternal Moon\" fell, the heavens and earth were thrown into chaos.\\nWhen the \"Iridescent Moon\" shattered, the crimson shadow sank into the abyssal sea.\\nWhen the \"Frost Moon\" ceased to turn, nations faltered and fell into ruin.\\n\\nBut the primordial perfumed sea still rippled for the thousand lunar quakes that shook it each year,\\nAnd the long ballad, woven from golden strings, never ceased, even when silver stars were cloaked in dust.\\nThrough the layers of the sky's veil, the people of the earth could not bask in true moonlight,\\nYet the tides of the river of time bound them together, come shadowed night or sunlit day.\\n\\nWe trace the paths of stars, or descend the stairs of shallow slumber;\\nBetween sunrise and sundown we wander, seeking the answer behind the screen;\\nOur hearts, no longer bound by Eternity, still stir — faint yet unceasing;\\nIn dreams between the eternal and the fleeting, we await the final hour offered to the moon."
