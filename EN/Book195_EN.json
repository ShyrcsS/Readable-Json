My beloved suffers and I grieve.\"\\nFan Jie: \"So it falls to my sword to bring judgment on those who so forsake the law.\"\\nFan Jie: \"Let us away.\"\\n(Fan Jie spurs his horse and heads for Wu Wang's stronghold)\\n(Aside)\\nFan Jie: \"Swiftly did I ride here, pursuing the sounds of merriment from afar.\"\\nFan Jie: \"This, then, must be the wolf's den.\"\\nFan Jie: \"If I am to rescue Zixin, I must scout their lair out with care.\"\\nFan Jie: \"A good plan. We go!\"\\n(Fan Jie leaps over the rear wall, exeunt.)\\n(Common time)\\nZixin: \"Within a lone lamp and half-burnt candles — and without lurk the wolves and tigers.\"\\nZixin: \"Who could have expected such disaster?
