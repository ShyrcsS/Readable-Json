Ever since he was a child, he's always been incredibly talented...\\n\\n...\\n...Out of consideration for everyone's safety, it has been decided that the Institute shall close. Driven by the energy and vigor of youth, the young ones are clamoring to go out and do battle. I hope someday they will understand the importance of prioritizing post-disaster reconstruction over marching off to die...\\n\\n...\\n...I fear that it shan't be long before we must depart. We've chosen a good piece of land near the Fountain of Lucine as the post-relocation site... They even say they want to use the land to build an opera house — they'd sooner set faces aflame with shame and laughter! To think that anyone could be so comical...\\n\\n...\\n...We're going to pay our respects at Basil's grave...\\n...I hope it all turns out like Emanuel said. However, it's the Institute's responsibility to support gifted and talented youths...\\n\\n...\\n...Met with the newly-appointed Iudex. He has a peculiar temperament.

Toxins remain in the soil and water and have not yet been fully neutralized... The water is producing deformed Oceanids... In a way, this could be a reflection of previous events. I only just learned that these are Karl's adopted children. It's a shame the Narzissenkreuz Institute no longer exists...\\n\\n...\\n...This could be the biggest breakthrough in a century, it will change all of society...\\n\\n...\\n...The report mentioned abnormal movements... I'll have to find a chance to talk to Emanuel about it..."
