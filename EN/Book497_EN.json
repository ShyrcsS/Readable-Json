    "Book497_EN.txt": "If Tarafa were writing this, I suppose he might say this...\\nYou who come after us:\\nWe are the descendants of Al-Ahmar. We are those who are fated to follow in the footsteps of the king of the crimson sands.\\nBut the prosperous past is too far gone, and there are many now whose faith wavers, just like Tarafa.\\nHe betrayed us, and took us for fools all the while.\\nUmur, Bahaddin, and Rabeed... All dead, due to his meddling.\\nMy own death I faked a few days prior to avoid his scrutiny, and I then struck first before he could attack Samail.\\nThis stone slate... It was her plot all along, that viper. Hah.\\nIt is likely, then, that there is no treasure to be found within Gurabad's corpse after all.\\nWe were deceived.\\nPerhaps our journey really was accursed, just as Tarafa claimed.\\nAnd our curse was Tarafa... and the mother he trusted in.\\nSamail says that this keystone might be real, but I doubt it. Whatever the case may be, it is now worthless to us.\\nSo let it lie here... and you who come after, hear me now: May you escape being deceived by those you trust.\\n\\nJebrael"
