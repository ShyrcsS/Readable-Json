    "Relic15037_2_EN.txt": "\\nSome say that the Mountain Rangers who came from the spring's source would leave these feather-like tokens on the paths they trod,\\nBoth to mark the road out and also to tell future visitors that someone had come this way in the past.\\nToday, these tokens lie silently in deserted nooks of the ash-laden ancient city.\\nAnd none would ever walk these paths again, just as those who left the tokens behind had hoped.\\n\\nThey had stepped on every firm rock in the mountain cliffs and trod upon every fallen leaf in the forest—\\nNever did they stop, those Mountain Rangers, they who had long committed every inch of Natlan to memory.\\nWhenever travelers or explorers from abroad arrived, they would enthusiastically serve as guides,\\nThough even those wondrous sights to behold were to them merely old childhood friends.\\nThen the day came when the black tide swept across the distant skies, and all that was once familiar vanished into the void.\\n\\nWhere children once played laughing in gardens, now only ashes and bones burned by wildfire remained.\\nWhere the tribespeople once washed their work fatigue away in hot springs, now fresh blood and mud ran over the banks.\\nBut the final Mountain Ranger had no time to stop and mourn, for there were things he had to do—\\nTo set out again on this path he no longer knew, and retake his home, once so familiar.\\n\\nLegends said that a treasure powerful beyond measure lay at the heart of the black tide, in the ancient city wherein a foul dragon lurked.\\nIt was akin to a golden wheel that could reverse time's flow, burning away the writhing agonized present and bringing the beautiful past back.\\nAs if grasping a last lifeline, the veteran, peril-proven Mountain Ranger decided to make this his final stop,\\nEven should it be yet another trap laid by some heartless spectator for the terrified people."
