No mourner disturbs their tranquil sleep.\\nIn cold repose, like frost on waters clear,\\nSorrow and pain, too, yield to a slumber deep.\\nWhat difference does it make? Dreams, like prayers, all prove vain.\\nLest idle tears should trace a fruitless way,\\nThis vow within my heart — I must embrace.\\nThough brief the moment, a moment's fleeting grace,\\nI must let this burning heart beat with fervent pace;\\nAnd let this passion, my soul's consuming shroud\\nForge a beacon. May it shine bright and bold; a brief beam to bid Elysium unfold.\\n\\nHave you beheld a dream more bright than gold?\\nCan you recall the paths of hate, of love?\\nThe twilight clouds in dusk's embrace unfold,\\nThe evening breeze scatters the light smoke above.\\nTime flies, and bygone days depart.\\nDo you still recall, or has memory flown?\\nYet still, someone must light the beacon's spark\\nEven on snow-clad fields and borderlands stark.\\n...\"\\n\\n\\nVIII\\nCovered in the pale, frost-colored moonlight,\\nThe valiant warrior journeyed to a foreign shore.\\nCountless souls lie buried within the ancient ruins,\\nInnumerable heroes faded where mists now stray.\\nThe dark tide of monsters galloped across the desolate expanse,\\nTrampling upon the hopes of all the living.\\nThus did the Nightingale forge the first beam of light upon the summit,\\nSubduing the insatiable delirium.\\n\\nThe biting gale blew with fervor, whilst the calamity was cast into the blackened light.\\nHe caught a fleeting glance of the still dawn, a glimpse of the eternal yesterday,\\nFate traversed the winds, between the living and the dead.\\nIn the long night, the sound of the lyre was akin to the fragrance of blossoms in the first stirring of spring.\\nParting the snow-curtain of the sky, The Nightingale would sing in praise of the sun.\\n\\nA generation akin to thunder's roar,\\nA generation steadfast as pine and cypress,\\nA generation resembling the mighty tide,\\nA generation fierce as the tempestuous wind,\\nInherited this name through the ages.\\n\\n...\\n\\n— Sergei Semyonovich Mayakov —\\nIII\\nAn unequal mortal duel, a hopeless deathmatch,\\nRelentless, pitch-black, towering waves loomed on one side,\\nWhilst an aged and feeble soul stood upon the other,\\nA weapon gripped tightly in his hand.\\n\\nThe voice in the mist spoke to him thus:\\nYou blind, reckless, malicious fool.\\nDo you have no care for the companions who trusted you?\\nYou, Mayakov, you arrogant madman,\\nIt was for your vile glory that\\nYou let the young lads lose their lives.\\nTheir mothers will never see their sons again,\\nNor their sons, their fathers.\\nHow pitiful, the orphans you adopted so hypocritically,\\nThey once again must endure the bitter anguish of losing a father.\\nWhy didn't you send out a distress signal?\\nWhy did you let the Lighthouse fall?\\nWhy strip the hope from your brethren?\\nLet them face death in desolation?\\nAn old man, who knows not the limits of his own strength!\\nThey all perished for your lofty ambitions,\\nAnd none remain to lay their bones to rest.\\nDear, dear Mayakov, yield now.\\nFor the sake of peace, let their souls find redemption.\\n\\nHe faced the ocean, shadowed by his gloom,\\nAnd with his hand, he shined his axe anew."
