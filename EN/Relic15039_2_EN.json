    "Relic15039_2_EN.txt": "\\nLegends told of a nightingale, carrying an ember in its beak, that flew only on moonless nights.\\nA speck of fire that would streak across the firmament like a shooting star; a light in dark times.\\n\\nUpon the ancient ruins of a castle, a vestige of an age of pioneers, stood the high tower of the \"Lightkeepers,\" standing guard through the long night.\\nCenturies had passed since their ancestors had stood before the Tsaritsa, swearing an oath of eternal fidelity,\\nAnd the people living in \"paradise\" believed that, so long as their lighthouse stayed lit, they could live in freedom,\\nNeither fearing the chaos wrought by the pitch-black beasts, nor needing to seek refuge in the lands to the north.\\nThen one night, a chilling sound carried over the horizon's edge — the leader of the Wild Hunt was abroad, galloping across the night sky.\\nAs ever, the night watchers laid down their great animal skin cloaks; yet that day, the sun rose not.\\n\\nAs the rallying horns echoed through the hills, warriors formed ranks at the high tower's foot,\\nAwaiting that momentous command to march south in fulfillment of their ancient vows.\\nYet in the great mead hall, the current Starshyna sat in silence;\\nFor already, a mighty host bright as midsummer's day had reached the city gates to the north.\\n\\n\"Warriors of the Pale Star, why do you choose this moment to knock at Piramida's gates?\"\\n\"Even you have no right to revoke the sacred powers bestowed upon us by Her Majesty the Tsaritsa.\"\\nThough they claimed to be reinforcements, these uninvited guests had ulterior motives, as the Starshyna knew full well;\\nBut to yield at this juncture would spell the end of the autonomy they had upheld for centuries past.\\n\\nFrom beneath the lead officer's mask came a voice, low and cold,\\nAnd in its wake a mocking laugh from parts unknown.\\n\"That is where the dark calamity began. Remember, Snezhnaya cannot bear the weight of your defeat.\"\\n\"Warriors of the Nightingale, fight with all your might! Yet, should none of you return...\"\\n\"Then we will take care of the 'aftermath.'\""
