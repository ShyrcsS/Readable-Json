They also served as tutors for the nobles.\\nTherefore, the scroll contains a wealth of information regarding history, governance, management, and culture.\\nWhen the people overthrew the royals, they exiled the royal mages at the same time,\\nFor the mages had forsaken their responsibility to instill goodness and virtue in the nobles, instead becoming birds of a feather with them.\\n\\nIn the early days of Mondstadt, the Lawrence Clan was led by Venerare.\\nUnder her guidance, the people built a tall statue in the plaza to commemorate the miracle of the Anemo Archon's descent.\\n\\nThe inscription beneath the statue was put there by the leader of all the clans. It bore an oath of protection to Mondstadt that they had sworn.\\nOver the years, the Lawrence Clan forsook the noble aspirations of their forebears, and the statue was taken down.\\nThe wise mages of the court spoke neither of history nor of the oath ever again.\\n\\nIn the age of the Knights of Favonius, the statue was rebuilt.\\nBut the wording of the oath on the inscription was lost forever.\\n"
