    "Book317_EN.txt": "The doctor said you were gravely ill. Don't worry. I will give everything I have to save you.\\n\\nMy heart bleeds whenever I see you getting wearier, your illness beyond treatment. How I wish I could suffer the pain for you...\\n\\nYou said you had no regrets in this life and that you only wish for me to take good care of Shenhe. But if you regret nothing, why the tears?\\n\\nI don't know what I've been doing lately. Though I still breathe, I feel like an empty shell. I have read all the ancient texts I could get my hands on, looking for ways to save you — but it is utterly futile.\\n\\nI finally found it! It was Mingjun! He had kept the book that could save you hidden! I took it and followed its instructions to summon a god and offer a sacrifice...\\n\\nThe god appeared. I told him that I was willing to exchange my life for yours. He kept silent and only pointed at our daughter, Shenhe.\\n\\nThe god said her fate was to bear the curse of calamity and that she was prone to bring harm to those close to her. The god also said that she might even have been the cause of your death. In that case, I thought I should...\\n\\nI left her in the cave that the god mentioned. Three days have passed, and still, no news. I grow restless from waiting, seized by an ominous feeling...\\n\\nI am sorry, my love. Forgive me! You too, Shenhe — please, forgive me! How stupid I was! How blind! Let me apologize to both of you... in person."
