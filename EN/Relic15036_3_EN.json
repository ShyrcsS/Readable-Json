    "Relic15036_3_EN.txt": "\\nSomeone once granted her desire, agreeing to remake the long-dulled feather accessories once the ancient kingdom had fallen.\\nAnd so she too promised that person, who had long earned her respect, that when the time came, she would give them a turquoise crown in return.\\nIt was after witnessing the crooked corpse agonizingly hunched beneath the black beast's butcher's blade that she understood,\\nThe crown she had forged and adorned with her own two hands would wait alone for its master, who would never attend the coronation.\\n\\nMany years later, the odd preferences of that aged mistress of the mines spread about the six tribes.\\nIt is said the old lady enjoyed all kinds of luxurious jewelry, much of which could no longer be made with the artistry of contemporary craftsmen.\\nAmong these, should it be a work signed by a specific artisan, and should one be willing to present it to her,\\nShe would exchange for it at any price in precious gems.\\nEven if it were a forgery, she would take it all the same.\\n\\nWhen the people of the tribe urged her to, at the very least, not reward the greed of frauds,\\nShe said, \"Ah, but I do this precisely because such crude forgeries cannot be allowed to stain his good name!\"\\nMoreover, though she did not advertise the fact, she never truly let such base cheats get away with their perfidy.\\n\\nIn contrast to the friends who had courageously sacrificed themselves, her life seemed too long by far. And so,\\nShe used the time left to her to gather all that was left behind by the heroes she missed.\\nThe scarlet-eyed youth she had loved had returned to the sacred flames after completing his calling, leaving nothing but a warm afterglow.\\nAnd when the silent hero fell into the ruler's flames, the new world reflected in his remaining eye was already his greatest reward.\\nOne of the hero twins was once an incorrigible chatterbox, yet upon witnessing his brother die at the hands of their adversary, his tormented wails wracked his throat hoarse.\\n\\n\"And yet Atawallpa, too, died before me... Who could have imagined that I, the frailest of us, would have lived to the end?\\nThe wise amongst the tribes often say that those who have been tossed about by the winds and waves will grow tired of the steady ground, and I am no exception.\\nThese years without all of you here... have truly been too dull.\"\\n\\nBut there will surely come a time for a reunion with friends long-since passed, and when long-awaited premonition comes to pass.\\nShe picked the genuine articles that the craftsman had made from among her jewels — compared with the forgeries, they were all too few,\\nAnd with those things bearing his name, she walked into the dark night, never to return.\\n\\nAccording to legend, on the next day, the people stood under the tree where she had placed the turquoise crown,\\nAnd they swore an oath to follow her final orders, blotting from history the name of the masterful craftsman she took away with her."
