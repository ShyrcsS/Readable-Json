    "Book294_EN.txt": "The nation of Kogami — a lifeless wasteland as far as the eye could see.\\nThe barren fields stretched out into the horizon around a large sand dune where the two samurai faced each other.\\nOne of them is our protagonist, and shall be named the green samurai to distinguish him from his compatriot.\\nThe other is a new arrival to the story. We shall name him the pale samurai.\\nIf this were a swashbuckler's tale, then they would have already taken up battle stances. But the two were not here to have a decisive match. They were just facing each other.\\n\\n\"Came back from hell, did you?\"\\nThe pale samurai said, the weight of time unknowable lying between them.\\n\"Nostalgic, isn't it?\"\\nThe green samurai seemed quite happy.\\n\"I don't get nostalgic over such things.\"\\nThe pale samurai interrupted rudely.\\nThe green samurai closed their eyes, as if sinking into the abyss of the past.\\n\\n\"'This will all end as long as we defeat the evil overlords.' That's what we believed then. Naive fools that we were — that was just the beginning of the nightmare.\"\\n\"The thirteen samurai banded together to defeat the Nakura Daimyo who had been destroying this nation.\"\\n\"But Kogami did not revive with the Daimyo gone, and the life-force of the land continued to bleed away.\"\\n\"Not only that — Kogami, now bereft of its ruler, became a paradise for those who would plunder it.\"\\n\"The heroes who had defeated the wicked overlord could not protect it in the end either.\"\\n\"In the end, only two escaped.\"\\n\"...Hey now, cut the reminiscence out for a second. We've got things to settle, don't we?\""
