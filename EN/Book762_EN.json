    "Book762_EN.txt": "Introduction\\nSince Monsieur Bossuet became the supervisor of the Bossuet Research Institute (formerly known as Alain Guillotin Memorial Research Institute), his flawless decisions and wise leadership have led to remarkable results in multiple research areas.\\nOut of respect and in gratitude to Monsieur Bossuet (Note: I am absolutely not being mandated to do this by Monsieur Bossuet himself), his highly original research results shall be collected here for future reference.\\n\\nJunior Researcher Chisseray\\n\\n...\\n\\nTitle: Theoretical Analysis and Design of the Novel Artificed Core Configuration\\nAuthors: Bossuet and Chisseray\\nIntroduction: This paper introduces a new theoretical artificed core configuration, elaborates on the operating principle and design requirements of the configuration, and compares it to the traditional configuration (Guillotin Configuration). Calculations show that in an ideal situation, the configuration's optimal output is slightly higher than the traditional one.\\n\\nRemarks:\\nThis paper was selected as Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering's Outstanding Paper of the Year, and as a result, Monsieur Bossuet has been awarded the title of Senior Technician.\\nJunior Researcher Chisseray\\n\\n...\\n\\nTitle: Research on Synchronous Control and Applications Based on the Novel Artificed Core Configuration\\nAuthors: Bossuet, Maillardet, and Chisseray\\nIntroduction: This paper explores the feasibility of applying the new artificed core configuration to synchronous control and proposes a new mode of artistic expression.\\n\\nRemarks:\\nUgh, if only Maillardet wasn't so obsessed with these weird dancing toys...\\nJunior Researcher Sevigne\\n\\nPlease do not write strange things in the remarks column.\\nJunior Researcher Chisseray\\n\\n..."
