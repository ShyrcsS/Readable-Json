The scribbled words on it read as follows...)\\nIt is evident that this place was originally intended to supply energy to this city of ashes...\\nBut it appears that something must have occurred to cause this function to cease.\\nThough there are signs of a battle here, the main structure of the buildings here have not been damaged. As such, battle damage did not cause the cessation. This seems more like the result of human operation.\\nThey say that only the master of Ochkanatlan, who has dominion over the entire city, may freely operate this giant city of machinery, as well as those modified Source Mechanisms...\\nBut why, then, did he shut off the supply of energy to Ochkanatlan?\\nDid someone else do it? Is there someone else apart from the Python King Och-Kan who can command these devices?"
