    "Relic15038_3_EN.txt": "\\nIn the era when the dark tide of filth arose from the sky's edge and heroes sun-bright marched forth to conquer,\\nMany stories transpired that were never recorded or eulogized in any human history.\\n\\nWhen human warriors bid farewell to their secluded villages and brought blessings of the Wayob to once-inaccessible, forbidden realms,\\nThe ancient dragons had become extinct from the fields they once ran upon, and the fruitful soil and springs had taken upon new colors.\\nThe palaces and temples built upon magma cliffs lost their luster, now silently waiting for the judgment at the end of days,\\nIn this dreamlike realm, cut off from the world, the end of the era of the ancients, too, drew nigh.\\nAnd in the lightless lands of night, the sacred ones continued their dissension over who would deliver this final verdict.\\n\\nHe was a hero unprophesied, a champion unaccounted for by any plan.\\nThis was a time when the war chiefs of the tribes had abandoned their great cause of slaying wicked dragons, vying power-drunk for supremacy;\\nWhen their warriors plunged into endless warfare, leaning on savage beasts for support.\\nAnd in those days from the dark lands rose a king bright as the newborn sun, warm as the budding dawn.\\nHe wore a crown woven from golden flowers, wielded a great blade of obsidian, and visited one tribe after another.\\n\\nDisagreements born from blades can only be resolved by the blade, and delusion born from ambition can only be subdued by ambition still greater.\\nAnd the one who had thought itself master over evolution never imagined that those with strength would give it an answer beyond conquest and slaughter.\\nUnder the sun's radiance did the tribes make a pact of armistice, and thus did the sacred ones of the night realm lay their arguments aside and offer him the crown.\\nThe dawn of a new era emerged over the horizon, and when that light illuminated the earth, even the beasts of darkness had nowhere to hide."
