It is a common sight during the summer festival.\\nIn the ghost stories of Inazuma,\\nThere is a tale about a meeting between the human and inhuman...\\n\\nTo celebrate my wife's pregnancy, I went to the shrine to give a votive offering.\\nBut for reasons unknown, I went up the mountain with these objects.\\nThe water balloon from when I seven, the fox mask from when I was seventeen,\\nAnd a flower that would not wilt in ten or even a hundred years.\\n\\nWhy did I expect to meet her again?\\nNo matchmaker introduced myself and my wife, and we were always short on money,\\nAnd it took some time for us to produce an heir,\\nBut our days were still filled with happiness, were they not?\\n\\nBut still I detoured on that mountain road to the place where I'd seen the fireworks with her.\\nPulling the bushes apart, I thought I saw her dressed in white, sitting upon that rock.\\nBut when I came forward and looked, it was just a fox sunbathing.\\nIt leaped up at the sound of snapping branches, and fled into the woods,\\nAnd like the spots of light that poke between leaves moved by the breeze, it was gone in a flash.\\nAll that was left was an old wooden throwing dart."
