    "Book708_EN.txt": "<center>The sky that night blossomed with flowers,\\nThe stars that night hummed like bees,\\nIn search of nectar and of dreams.\\nAnd we, that night, were as new as the dew,\\nUnder moonlight flowing like silken honey,\\nOur words sweet as we sat by the spring.\\nBut I turned and left you alone,\\nThe poem in my heart left unspoken.\\nAnd since then,\\nThe stars do not twinkle, the moon is ice-cold.\\nI hide them 'neath the water,\\nBut your tears fall and find them.</center>"
