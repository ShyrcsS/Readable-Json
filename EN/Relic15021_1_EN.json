    "Relic15021_1_EN.txt": "\\nAmenoma, Futsu, Isshin, Hyakume, Senju.\\nThese were, once upon a time, the five branches of the Raiden Gokaden,\\nBut today, only Amenoma still maintains its line of succession.\\nWhile the Isshin line can just barely be said to have extant descendants.\\nIn the eyes of the people, this is just the natural result of the ravages of time.\\nThey never once suspected that such sudden falls from grace might have some hidden mystery behind them.\\n\\nThe wanderer would never admit to this.\\nHe would never admit that he had done this as an act of revenge against the bladesmith.\\nNor would he ever mention the truth,\\nThat he had abandoned his schemes halfway because they had suddenly become dull.\\nHe would only say, in that tone of voice he had learned from a certain researcher:\\n\"It was all just a little experiment into human nature.\"\\n\\nIn Inazuma's traditional theater, there is a certain character known as \"Kunikuzushi.\"\\nSuch characters are often schemers and usurpers of nations.\\nAt the end of his wanderings, he chose this name as an act of his own will.\\nAnd as for the name he had once used, even he no longer remembered it.\\n\\nIt is a norm in Inazuma's traditional theater to join the names of a play's three acts together to form the play's name.\\nFor example, \"Sumirezome,\" \"Sangetsu,\" and \"Kogetsukan\" come together,\\nThus forming the play \"Sumirezome Sangetsu Kogetsukan.\"\\nPerhaps a day will come when this body's adventures, its experiences,\\nWill become tales to be passed along by mortals, distant memories that flow through the ley lines.\\nBut for now, his third act is still ongoing."
