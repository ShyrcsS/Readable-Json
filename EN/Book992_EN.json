The scribbled words on it read as follows...)\\n\"Hollow\" is the term that the scrolls, at least, use to describe this huge structure that surrounds the city.\\nBut it seems evident from my investigation that these \"hollows\" actually precede Ochkanatlan itself.\\nRather than say that these were built around Ochkanatlan to supply the city with energy...\\nOne should say, instead, that Och-Kan piggybacked off these devices and built his new city atop the original one, which had been built by the ancient dragons...\\nThis might also explain why the scale of the underground areas, and some of the surface ones too — such as the width of the roads, or the size of the buildings — are as they are, seeming to have been built for beings that dwarf the average human."
