    "Relic15021_4_EN.txt": "\\nWhat he saw in his dream was a phantom dancing to the music under the moonlight,\\nJust like the young man in the distant past, who was akin to a blank sheet of paper,\\nAnd like a pure yet fragile persona,\\nEmerging once the resentment and suffering had dissipated.\\n\\nThe wanderer did not know that he had any faculties for dreaming,\\nThinking that this must have been the researchers' little trick,\\nOr perhaps it was the infinitesimal resistance of that bygone heart.\\n\\n\"You once acquired the 'heart' that you always dreamed of,\"\\n\"But it was but a mere prop for lies and deception.\"\\n\"Now, you will finally obtain what belongs to you,\"\\n\"And this false construct of a body can at last aspire to power over this world.\"\\n\\n\"Yet, this is all but a fleeting dream of glory.\"\\n\"And it will all one day drift away amidst the sighs of a suffering earth...\"\\nWas it a \"him\" from the past who said this? Or \"him\" from the future?\\nThe vagrant cared not, for when he awakened,\\nIt was not he, but that ethereal future that dissipated."
