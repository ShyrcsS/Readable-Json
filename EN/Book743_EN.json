He puked and got the runs, then was laid up in the infirmary for three whole days.\\nI'm sure it's because Fontainian plants aren't healthy enough. I ought to replace the Rainbow Rose with Sumeru Rose and Pluie Lotus with Nilotpala Lotus.\\n\\nBulle Fruit Juice, Sumeru Rose distillate, Nilotpala Lotus distillate, Cinnamon, Honey, Tidalga, Condessence Crystal Powder.\\nKoblenz refused point-blank to try again no matter what.\\nSpent 280 Credit Coupons to get Delassaux to test the drink. Feedback wasn't bad. He said he felt quite perky after just one sip, so I'm on the right track. I can cut the Bulle Fruit Juice out, though, since it's little more than flavoring. Not like I'm making Fonta, anyway.\\n\\nSumeru Rose distillate, Nilotpala Lotus distillate, Tidalga, Ore Powder.\\nThe yellowish green ore outside looked better than Condessence Crystals... Got a small piece near the storehouse and ground it up to replace the Condessence Crystal Powder.\\nTried it, has a rich distinctive flavor. This wholesome healthy drink is sure to be a success this time."
