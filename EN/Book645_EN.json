Why do others always toot her horn?\"\\n\"Do I, the donkey, not labor every day? Yet, no one cares to even greet me with a smile.\"\\n\"Since this is the case, I shall learn from the fox and do the same as she.\"\\n\"Her little tricks, surely, shall be mine in no time.\"\\n\\nThus, the donkey hid among the trees, and waited for its target to come by.\\nAs the daughter of the cheesemaker passed by, the donkey bounded over,\\nAnd imitating the fox, raised a hoof and said with a smug voice,\\n\"Ha! Listen to me! You know nothing about swift travel.\"\\n\"Just throw all your cheese away. Shall your cart not arrive sooner that way?\"\\n\\nThe young lady was shocked, and she immediately replied,\\n\"Oh, you silly donkey! You dare to try to pull my leg?\"\\n\"Get me my stick! I'm driving this beast back to the mill!\"\\nSeeing the stick being waved at it, the donkey ceased speaking at once.\\n\\nThis tale explains how trying to be someone else and smothering your own identity,\\nIs by no means beneficial. Indeed, it only leads to more suffering."
