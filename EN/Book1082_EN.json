Soon, he'll go totally blind.\\nAlso, according to your instructions, I went to the Asha's home, and sure enough, Rekis had sent some other guys. They used cages to catch a few Asha, but I made sure to get rid of them.\\nAlso, also, I found that the Me & Dew and The Dewdrop sell some pretty good Aphimead and juice. Some passersby recommended the places to me, and so I'm recommending them to you in this letter.\\nIf we can bring some back, we should be able to make a killing.\\n(...At the end of the letter is a line of messy writing...)\\n♪~♪~♪~ Tasty, tasty Aphimead! ♪~♪~♪~\\n♪~♪~♪~ Don't forget! Steal some and bring it back to Nasha Town! ♪~♪~♪~\\n"
