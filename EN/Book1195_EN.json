    "Book1195_EN.txt": "...\\n\\nSylvester's departed in the end.\\n\\nThis should be the last time I return here to pen notes. I was planning to burn everything I'd written before, but after burning half of it, I thought about it and gave up on the endeavor.\\n\\nBetter to leave something behind. Because apart from this, there's really nothing else.\\n\\nIn accordance with his own wishes, his funeral was remarkably quiet. The handful of Lightkeepers he trained personally shed no tears for him, which is understandable. If I could live to his age, free from illness and disaster, returning peacefully to the earth, I wouldn't want others to weep for me either. Besides, Lightkeepers are well accustomed to parting with the dead.\\n\\nAila didn't come to his funeral. I assumed she had no idea, so I made a special trip to Hiisi Island.\\n\\nThe place had been nearly demolished, with only the central grand temple and the tower to the north remaining. Her maid, whose name I cannot recall, though I remember Aila saying that she was an adopted orphan from foreign lands, spoke to me timidly, saying that the Lady Moonchanter had long known of my coming and was aware of the Lightkeeper's affairs. She had no intention of seeing me and asked me to leave.\\n\\nIf she doesn't want to see me, so be it. Not that there'd be much to say if we did meet, anyway."
