It shall be an amnesiac world, lost to itself.\"\\nIn the heart of eternity, those old friends still appear so clear and the scent of the sakura remains so fresh.\\n\\nBut I will never forget you, just as I will not forget the things that were lost across the years.\\nAfter all...\\n\\nHaving witnessed the pitch-dark annihilation consume those precious to her,\\nHow could she not see the absurd nature of life and death, yes, incomprehensible destiny itself, as her mortal foe?\\nBut since no one can overturn the impermanence of the world, and the barren nature of this game,\\nThen let the eternal euthymia within her heart carry forth into the nation she loves."
