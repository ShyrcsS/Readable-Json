Let's talk then.\"\\nBut that which came from the waters was not that which she had thought would come, and would vanish henceforth back into those waters...\\n\\nTill today, the artisans of Yilong Port still make such simple ornaments.\\nVisiting merchants will also often place these jade loops close to their ears, as the legend says,\\nWondering if they can truly hear the sound of the rain pitter-pattering on mountain stone."
