    "Book650_EN.txt": "By the banks of the world's purest lake,\\nThere once stood a glistening castle.\\nGold leaf and gems decorated its walls,\\nAnd it shone blinding in the post-noon sun.\\nPretty banners and flags flew from the roof,\\nWhile majestic towers soared alongside.\\nGuests from afar peered through colorful windows,\\nAnd marveled at the wonders every step revealed.\\nYet none was more marvelous than the many statues,\\nOdd in form but as real as life.\\nIn the center of the hall sat a golden stage,\\nWhere musicians played day and night for the castle's master.\\nAs the music sounded, listeners flocked like swarming bees,\\nTo dance in time with the beat that seemed to captivate the entire world.\\nThe wine flowed never-ending to sate the thirst for revelry.\\nAll could partake, no matter their class or their homeland,\\nBut none of this could ease the master's fears,\\nOr bring his troubled soul a moment of peace.\\nAnd each time the tower's clock struck its deep midnight chime,\\nHe would be possessed by an uncontrollable panic,\\nTrapped by his fears and his gloom.\\nThe dark-robed figure would surely collect on debts owed,\\nAnd all before his eyes would be turned into dust,\\nThe souls of his guests, and his own, included,\\nAs tribute to that dark, ancient world."
