You want to take revenge?\\nWakayama Keisuke: We're not children anymore, how can you still be just as impulsive as you were back then?\\nWakayama Keisuke: *sigh* With Lord Kurotani's abilities, the investigation never should have gone as wrong as it did.\\nWakayama Keisuke: But he said himself that he was willing to accept the blame and punishment.\\nWakayama Keisuke: The punishment from the great lords was indeed harsh...\\nWakayama Keisuke: But Lord Kurotani asked for it himself. I fear that there is still much left unsaid here.\\nWakayama Keisuke: Kurotani and Wakayama are both reputable clans.\\nWakayama Keisuke: You now carry the clan name. You're a samurai in service of the public, not some wandering Nobushi ronin.\\nWakayama Keisuke: So no matter how angry you are, you must be patient right now. You mustn't seek revenge.\\nKurotani Seishimaru: What's suspicious is some of the great lords' men!\\nKurotani Seishimaru: They've been mighty pleased with themselves since my father's death.\\nWakayama Keisuke: That's your anger clouding your judgment. They didn't necessarily have anything to do with it. Calm down!\\nSeishimaru looks out the door.\\nKurotani Seishimaru: <color=#00E1FFFF>Whoever's eavesdropping outside, come on in.</color>\\nWakayama Keisuke: Who are you? Who sent you to listen in on our conversation?\\nMachiko shows herself.\\nYano Machiko: M—My apologies, good samurai, I—I'm just a tea seller, and my name is Machiko.\\nYano Machiko: It wasn't my intention to eavesdrop.\\nYano Machiko: Seishimaru saved my life yesterday, and {M#he}{F#she} didn't ask for rice or money.\\nYano Machiko: I just wanted to repay {M#him}{F#her} and then go back to selling my tea. I didn't mean any offense, honest!\\nKeisuke looks at Seishimaru. Seishimaru nods.\\nWakayama Keisuke: You... Forget it, it's to be expected that a mere tea vendor wouldn't know proper etiquette.\\nWakayama Keisuke: Still, remember to address {M#him}{F#her} as \"Master Kurotani\" from now on.\\nWakayama Keisuke: You know what? This is quite opportune. The Kurotani Clan needs people, after all.\\nWakayama Keisuke: Why don't you stop selling tea and go with Master Kurotani?\\nYano Machiko: I don't wish to call {M#him}{F#her} Master Kurotani. Seishimaru has a better ring to it.\\nYano Machiko: And well, if I can get my fill of food, then sure! I'll follow Seishimaru.\\nWakayama Keisuke: ...Do whatever you like. Seishimaru, Lord Kurotani is gone...\\nWakayama Keisuke: You're in charge of things now. Don't do anything foolish.\\nWakayama Keisuke: If you let your temper get the better of you... *sigh* Anyway, what's important is that your family name continues.\\nKurotani Seishimaru: <color=#00E1FFFF>It wasn't your adoptive parents who died.</color>\\nWakayama Keisuke: ...Seriously? Has anything I've said made it through that thick skull of yours?\\nWakayama Keisuke: Let me ask you this. Will you really raise your blade against the great lords' men without a care for your clan!?\\nWakayama Keisuke: Do you really wish to bring shame to your lord and disaster upon your family?\\nSeishimaru remains silent.\\nWakayama Keisuke: Oh, great. This is just great! So no one shall have peace until your rage dissipates, yes?\\nWakayama Keisuke: Well, since all my efforts to persuade you otherwise have been ineffective, then let me give you the truth straight out.\\nWakayama Keisuke: Now, I've been the head of the Wakayama Clan since my father passed away.\\nWakayama Keisuke: He served as Lord Kurotani's executioner.\\nWakayama Keisuke: I know very well that he wronged your family and did great hurt to its name.\\nWakayama Keisuke: And the execution was a matter of business, yes. But you're still my friend, and I still want to look after your family if at all possible...\\nWakayama Keisuke: So, if you still want revenge, I fear I must say that my father is already dead.\\nWakayama Keisuke: Come on then, punish me for his sins instead. I dare you.\\nWakayama Keisuke: What? Are you hesitating because we are friends?\\nWakayama Keisuke: Is that the extent of your resolve? Really? You can't even cut ties with me!\\nKurotani Seishimaru: I was adopted anyway. The family name means nothing to me.\\nKurotani Seishimaru: Besides, is the good standing of the \"Kurotani\" name really more important than my parents' lives?\\nKurotani Seishimaru: Well, I'll show you my resolve. Draw your weapon!\\nKurotani Seishimaru: Put it and that Temari over there on the table.\\nSeishimaru closes {M#his}{F#her} eyes.\\nKurotani Seishimaru: I'll close my eyes until you've placed them. Then, I'll extend a finger.\\nKurotani Seishimaru: If I point at your sword, then we must face each other in battle. If I point at the Temari, then we will sever all the bonds that lie between us.\\nKurotani Seishimaru: Let us leave this to fate.\\nWakayama Keisuke: Hmph, so be it. We're all set.\\nThe sword is on Seishimaru's left and the Temari is on {M#his}{F#her} right. Eyes closed, Seishimaru <color=#00E1FFFF>points to the left</color> and then opens {M#his}{F#her} eyes.\\nKurotani Seishimaru: It looks like our destiny has been decided. My life shall be devoted to vengeance. There shall be no rest till one of us is dead.\\nWakayama Keisuke: Since you've made up your mind, then I must man up as well.\\nWakayama Keisuke: I'll carry everything I said before through to the end. I'll be waiting for you.\\nWakayama Keisuke leaves."
