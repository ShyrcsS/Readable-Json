The feasibility of high-density energy barrier generation has been experimentally verified. With current technology, barrier generators can stably produce energy barriers in various shapes, including spherical configurations.\\nProlonged, high-intensity generator operation can cause overheating and material fatigue. This not only reduces the device's lifespan but may also result in minor energy leakage. Although currently minimal, the long-term effects are uncertain and could present potential risks. Continued monitoring and attention are advisable.\\nData must be collected from multiple sources for aggregated analysis to gain further insight."
