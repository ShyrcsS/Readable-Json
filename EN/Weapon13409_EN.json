My journey is ended.\"\\n\"I shall sleep beneath this white, shining silver... and perhaps this, too, is good.\"\\n\"Farewell, O lovely bard! And farewell, O lovely dragon!\"\\n\"Would that we had met in a different time and place,\"\\n\"To meet, to sing and dance together!\"\\nSo he thought most sincerely as he lay dying.\\n\\n\"Now then, this great blessing that pulses through my veins,\"\\n\"And the lovely sight of the dark universe that gave me birth...\"\\n\"They are now yours to inherit.\"\\n"
