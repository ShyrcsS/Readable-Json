Love her, and be loyal to her.\"\\n\"She is no less than I, and her light is yet more radiant than mine.\"\\n\"I once encountered a faceless nightmare in my dreams, and it frightened me to no end.\"\\n\"And so I separated you from my body, and I ask you now to prevent that nightmare's coming.\"\\n\\n\"My Khvarena, the light of my eyes...\"\\n\"I once warned her of the coming of the dark tide, and it is from this that your destiny arises.\"\\n\"Please do not be afraid, and do not flee, do not let your Khvarena dim, and do not disgrace your mother.\"\\n\"Just as it is my fate to sacrifice myself for mortals, so too is sacrifice the beautiful prelude to new life...\"\\n\"Go now, into your verdant mother's embrace. You shall find your destiny in her realm.\"\\n\\n\"My Khvarena, my pure daughter...\"\\n\"You shall change utterly. You shall face the trial of division and death.\"\\n\"And after that, you shall become immortal — and yet that shall be a harder road still...\"\\n\"The lord of sweet dew and the lord of grass and trees shall precede you in losing their divine forms...\"\\n\"They shall be forgotten, and only the memory of your sacrifice will be remembered.\"\\n\\n\"My Khvarena, daughter of flowers...\"\\n\"If you are resolved to not retreat out of fear...\"\\n\"Then throw yourself into the embrace of your new mistress.\""
