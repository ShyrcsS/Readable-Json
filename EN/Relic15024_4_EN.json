    "Relic15024_4_EN.txt": "\\nEach year, when the Spiritscent Flowers bloom, Qiaoying Village will prepare for its tea-serving ceremonies.\\nOnce the flowers wither, flower tea infused with nine layers of scents are presented in the village hall.\\nThe Spiritscent Flower is a fleeting thing, much like the sudden coming and going of a certain adeptus.\\nThis one left behind the ambiguous name of \"Herblord,\" as well as many foggy and fragmented legends.\\n\\nIn one such tale, the Herblord's adeptal form would turn into the branches of an ancient tea tree.\\nIn another, the adeptus flew up to the adeptal mountain on a subdued evil beast.\\nThere is even a story that goes like this—\\n\\nThe young lady grasped at the hooded hat on the ground as she struggled ashore, placing it on her head haphazardly.\\nFor if she did not cover her face, then she might feel embarrassed and find herself at a loss for words.\\nJust then, the orchestrator of her suffering poked their head out of the water.\\nThe rainbow-scales on their body glimmered, as if to revel in this victory.\\n\\n\"*cough* Alright! So you can swim! Very impressive! ...You know what? May you drown someday!\"\\n\\nShe spoke these words in anger, but also in jest.\\nAnd yet that glittering streak would eventually sink into the depths, never to come back to the surface."
