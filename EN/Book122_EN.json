From them, she grew to understood the world outside the spring a little more.\\nThose tears flowed into the water, and the fairy purified them, turning them into a sweet nectar that brought him sweet dreams. The boy forgot the pain of his waking hours, and met the silent fairy by her spring in his sleep.\\n\\nEvery time that happened, the fairy too would smile, asleep in the pool drenched in moonlight.\\nThe fresh dew nourished the boy's dreams, and the boy's dreams rejuvenated the lonely fairy's soul.\\nIn those dreams, the spring fairy told the boy tales of the faraway realm of Hydro. She spoke of her sapphire-blue homeland, she sang of the homesickness of exile, and she sighed for separation and belonging. In these dreams, the boy became the one who silently listened, who wept for her troubles, and who rejoiced in her happiness.\\n\\nOver time, the spring fairy gained the power of speech from the boy's memories and dreams.\\nOver time, they became friends who shared all."
