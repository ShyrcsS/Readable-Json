    "Book1142_EN.txt": "...\\nTruth takes time to build, but lies can be created overnight.\\nIf slander continues to spread, the foundations of trust will be eroded.\\nEven the strongest oath of loyalty will not survive amid suspicion.\\nExploiting the arrogance of the nobility, allowing hatred to grow and spread,\\nThus lending opportunity to the most deeply hidden evil intentions.\\nThis is the second of his three great sins.\\n...\\nWith a stone pillar as its seal, and a spell as its shroud,\\nLet the evidence of the Serpent of All Evils' crimes be inscribed within the lantern's shade."
