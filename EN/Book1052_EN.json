    "Book1052_EN.txt": "(A letter received several months ago)\\n...It was you. You let the lumiline through, didn't you?\\nI know you were responsible for purchasing the problematic ingredient that day.\\nWhat would your good friend think, I wonder, if she learned that she suffered on account of your negligence? What would the people in the hotel think?\\nSo. I imagine you'd like to keep this a secret from Escoffier... Wouldn't you, Head Chef Savanna?\\n\\n(A letter received several weeks ago)\\n...Retrieve the real Codex. By any means necessary!\\nThat's where the real treasure can be found — and you gave it away, like a fool! Well then. You're going to get it back, whether in a bet, or by force, it doesn't matter!\\nOh. I know. Don't you have that \"cooking showdown\" of yours?\\n...And if you don't think you can win, why, you simply need to have your opponent lose. I imagine that assistant of yours might come in handy in that regard...\\n\\n(A letter received not long ago)\\nWhat are you dawdling for? She was the one who concealed the secret recipe in the first place!\\nWhy else do you think you've never been able to recreate her work? She's afraid. Afraid that you'll outshine her!\\nWhat do you imagine everyone says about you, both within and beyond the hotel walls!? Ordinary, they call you. Untalented! A hack! A failure who will never surpass Escoffier!\\nAnd you know whose fault that is? That's right, it's hers... She's no saint, never has been — so why hesitate?"
