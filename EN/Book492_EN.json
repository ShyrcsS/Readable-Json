It covered all our eyes, and it will cover you, perhaps even before it shall see you erased.\"\\nBefore we set out, I stated that this was a journey accursed, but no one would listen.\\nI know who it is I must believe. The nourisher of my spirit, the servant of the Goddess of Flowers — she knows that which is true.\\nNow, we have lost Umur. As we approached the ruins of Gurabad, he was separated from us by a cyclone. His body was buried beneath the rolling sands, and his spirit now swirls in the wind for ever. He shall never know peace.\\nPerhaps we should advance no further.\\n\\nTarafa"
