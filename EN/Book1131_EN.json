    "Book1131_EN.txt": "...\\n...In accordance with the teachings of the apostle of the Golden City, all matters concerning craftsmanship and secret rites must be recorded without the taint of personal sentiment, for mortal tongues cannot articulate the sacred mysteries, and frail emotion would only profane the words of our ancestors. Do not seek to understand what lies beyond mortal intellect. Simply recite the ancient prayers with a sincere heart so that the purity of the blessings may endure.\\n\\nThis decree was issued by Saredne, humble handmaiden of the Frost Moon and 13th Archpriestess since the fall of Hyperborea. It is not to be defied. In the name of the mistress of the Frost Moon, the ancient laws, once obscure and difficult to understand, are now set forth in clear and concise terms, lest the faithful falter or be led astray.\\n\\n...\\nDecree III: Elysium and the Prophecy of the Sacred Heir\\nLet the children of Hyperborea guard their sacred bloodline from defilement, for the heir of Elysium is destined to one day arrive.\\nIt is hereby forbidden to marry one's closest kin. That is to say, no union shall be permitted between blood relatives.\\nIt is forbidden to enter into marriage with someone from a clan that has committed blasphemy.\\nIt is forbidden to enter into marriage with someone from a clan that has taken the life of an innocent.\\nIt is forbidden to enter into marriage with someone from a clan that has broken its oath.\\nIt is forbidden to enter into marriage with someone from a clan that does not bear an antlered crown.\\nIt is forbidden to enter into marriage with someone from a clan that has committed parricide.\\nIt is forbidden to enter into marriage with any person disturbed of mind.\\nIt is forbidden to enter into marriage with the descendants of the fae.\\nIt is forbidden to enter into marriage with a person not of the faith.\\nIt is forbidden to enter into marriage with an outlander.\\nMarriage is a most sacred act of virtue and must be kept pure. Therefore, let no unclean act stain our bloodline.\\nLet no action be taken to incur the displeasure of the mistress of the Frost Moon, and let no one betray their oaths.\\nWhosoever enters into marriage must first obtain the permission and blessing of the Archpriestess, lest a curse befall their bloodline.\\nSaid curse shall plague their bloodline for seven generations, and then for seven more.\\nWhosoever breaks this oath shall have their horns severed with a silver blade. They who have been marked thus shall be cast into the long, lightless night.\\nHear now the ancient prophecy: In the fullness of time, Elysium shall come, and with it, the sovereign ordained to rule over it shall also appear.\\nThe false sevenfold radiance of the high heavens shall fall at her feet, and the bones of the earth shall rise to follow her.\\nFor from her shall spring union with the world, and from her shall the first great cause be rebuilt.\\nLet these words of wisdom find root in your heart, and neglect not the sanctity of your blessed bloodline.\\n\\n...\\nDecree VI: Offerings to the Sampo Mill\\nThe children of Hyperborea shall guard the sacred treasure forged by the apostle of the Golden City at all costs.\\nLet it be known that the relic that is the Sampo Mill is a sacred work, for its blessing yields unending gold, grain, and salt.\\nOnly the prophesied sacred heir shall have the power to rouse the Mill, and thus bring forth an Elysium of eternal abundance for us all.\\nAccording to the revelation of our ancestors, the Mill shall be sealed within a holy sanctum to preserve it from taint and desecration until the appointed time, when the sacred heir is born at last.\\nAll followers below the rank of priestess shall not enter the holy sanctuary wherein the Mill is sealed. Those who violate this precept shall have a curse befall their bloodline.\\nSaid curse shall plague their bloodline for seven generations, and then for seven more.\\nBefore sowing in spring, an offering of wheat, goat's milk, and salt must be made unto the Sampo Mill, lest famine befall you.\\nAt least one priestess shall be designated to chant prayers to the Mill day and night, to ensure a bountiful harvest and enduring prosperity.\\n\\n...\\nDecree X: Offering to the Arrow of Terpikeraunas\\nThe children of Hyperborea shall revere the Arrow of Terpikeraunas without fail.\\nLet it be known that this relic, forged of pure light, is a bow and arrow that can pierce the manifold darkness of the frozen night.\\nYou shall mix the sacred oils in the following manner prescribed by the rites of the ancestors:\\nTake up a clean silver vessel free from all dust and water, for defilement is the root of all corruption.\\nTake the fat of a lamb, clear and pure, and warm it over a gentle fire.\\nIt must not be too hot, or too cool. Do not bring it to a boil.\\nAdd sulfur, salt, sawdust, and wax in their proper order while stirring with great care.\\nStir until the substances inside the vessel are of one uniform color.\\nThe number for your counting shall be seven hours. Six you shall not count, neither count you eight,\\nExcepting that you should count to seven. Five and nine are right out.\\nThen, anoint your bow and arrows with the holy oil,\\nAnd your arrows shall snuff out the pitch-black foe, shattering them like plates of silver."
