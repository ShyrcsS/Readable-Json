    "Book337_EN.txt": "—Modest Fortune—\\nA gust of wind suddenly whistles through the clear skies. What might this mean?\\nThough you may feel like you're just spinning your wheels, this is only temporary.\\nLook out for those who appear around you, familiar though those faces may be.\\nWho knows? Your fate may be changed by their presence without your knowledge...\\n\\nYour lucky object for the day: A dandelion from a faraway land.\\nSeeds that follow the wind are a most fitting symbol for you.\\nFly, drift, across the seas, to lands far away.\\nBut one day, you will no longer drift.\\nOne day, you will become what you hope to be."
