    "Relic15044_3_EN.txt": "\\nBlood-red wine gleamed in golden cups, water-hued jade lay upon pale braids.\\nBare feet no longer treaded slivers of silver snow; only slivered silver fell about her feet like snow.\\nBeneath the shadow of the towering spire, amidst a prison of delusive enchantment, the huntress believed herself cherished by a tyrant.\\nConsider the wandering craftsman who proffered to her a mechanical singing bird of pure gold, begging only for his life.\\nBoth his hands were shorn by her King's cold, sharp wind, lest such a toy ever be made again for another's delight.\\n\\nWhen the bloodline, steeped in ancient ignorance, bowed down to the wrathful wind, offering her like a sacrifice to the king of the spire,\\nThe huntress, who once roosted with owls on withered boughs and danced with hawks across the plains,\\nKnew not that the Lord of Wind, feared by all, would elevate her to the place of favored counsel, so skilled was she with the bow.\\nBefore she met her king, she knew not the tenderness of love, nor the searing sting of hate.\\nBefore she met her king, no human heart had ever stirred the huntress treading the plains.\\n\\nIf there are those born with dreams of kindness and liberty, yearning to cleave the wind-wrought wall of desolation with their song,\\nAnd if even gods may be ensnared by their own delusion and conceit, doomed to drown in the barren dream called eternity,\\nThen there are those, born wanting, only able to fill their hollow hearts with blind devotion.\\n\\n\"My beloved master... Save you, none have shown me gentle dreams.\"\\n\"Neither the kiss of waves upon sand, nor greenwood's embrace of verdant earth.\"\\n\\nThe fierce wind never reflected the suffering of cowering ants,\\nAnd she beheld none but the lonely figure of the God King.\\nFor her master and savior, who taught her the meaning of love,\\nIt was fitting that those fearful, loathing eyes were quenched.\\n\\nHowever—\\n\\nIt mattered not the victories she offered to her king,\\nHow many throats she pierced in his dungeons,\\nHow many rebel villages lay in ruins,\\nHow many times whispers were gently spoken in his ear...\\nThe king, enthroned atop the spire, crowned by the fierce wind,\\nWho scorned, oppressed, and indulged each of his subjects,\\nNever poured upon her the love he spoke of.\\nNever was he miserly in the love given to the commoners —\\nThat fierce wind that could tear mortal flesh.\\n\\nAwoken from blind devotion, she realized she was the only one who spoke with sincerity.\\nFrom the first meeting, and all the days between,\\nHer likeness was never mirrored in the depths of his eyes.\\n\\nYes, yes, if even dances offered beneath the veil of wind and gentle whispers could not earn her a moment of his gaze,\\nIf all bloodied glory and the delight of slaughter could not make him look only upon her...\\n\\nThen let his gaze linger forever upon the moment her image was seared into it.\\nThis she could grasp, the sole treasure worthy of repaying the King's love.\\nThis alone, of all that he had shown, might rightly be named as love indeed.\\nFor he spoke of love, but was only accompanied by razor winds.\\n\\n\"My beloved master... Save you, my heart shall love no other.\"\\n\"So I beg you — look only upon me, none but me.\"\\n\\n— Thus spoke one, a mortal knowing naught of love, to a god who could not know it.\\nEven in the moment they tore each other apart, neither had ever truly known the other's heart."
