    "Weapon15427_EN.txt": "\\nA tool often used for urban construction and ruin exploration in the past.\\nOften used to measure angles, it also possessed a state of the art ability to measure and estimate distance.\\nRelying on precisely crafted special arrows and the hands of trained professionals,\\nIt could keep the flight trajectory of arrows as straight as light itself.\\n\\nIn addition to planning and construction, it also often came in handy for exploration and even criminal investigations.\\nIn skilled hands, its distance measurements could be highly accurate.\\nDuring past explorations of the ruins of Remuria, the exploration teams often brought this range gauge along,\\nMostly to locate the historic sites buried by time and destruction.\\nEven the modern Hurlock novels that gained great popularity later on,\\nWould feature it in a story about locating a secret chamber.\\n\\nPresently, many range gauges are gathering dust on the shelves of antique shops or attic cellars.\\nAs more and more similar tools with greater ease-of-use and a lower skill requirement came into general use,\\nThe production of special arrows has completely ceased, and they too were soon lost and forgotten.\\nHowever, as the gauge remains a longbow that can be carried around without arousing any suspicion or questioning,\\nIt has been used for several purposes beyond its original design during some certain tumultuous times."
