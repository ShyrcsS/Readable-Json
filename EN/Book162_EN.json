I'm saying that only the Andromeda Empire would be capable of kidnapping you and the Princess.\" Ike then turned to face the innumerable lives that dwelled within the galaxy.\\nHe paused for a moment before declaring thus: \"Inhabitants of the galaxy. Though I have come here upon the invitation of the High Saint King Lebannin to re-ignite the flames of the few remaining stars, it seems that the Andromeda Empire does not wish for your longevity, and has thus kidnapped my friend.\"\\n\"Are you then to put their lives over that of all life?\" Saint King Lebannin arose from her seat. \"If that is the case, why then do I rule over these stars?\"\\n\\nFinally, the Saint King would charge into peril alone, defeat the assassins from the Andromeda Empire, and rescue both the Princess and Sachi. Afterward, she had a few words with Ike.\\n\"I didn't think you could defeat the dominant species of Andromeda,\" Ike praised. \"They're a strong and hardy race.
