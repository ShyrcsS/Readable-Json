    "Book293_EN.txt": "People call war hell, but most are just describing it as such.\\nBut what appeared before their eyes could only truly be called \"hell.\"\\nThe desolate earth, the withered trees, and people like the shambling dead.\\nIt was like the life had been wrung from this place.\\n\"Huh.\"\\nThe samurai picked a husk of a leaf. It crumbled into dust immediately, floating away on the wind.\\n\"It seems like the life has literally been wrung out from this place.\"\\n\\nConflict had raged around the capital for over a century now.\\nAfter the first decade, the resources and riches of the various warring nations had already been all but spent.\\nThe thing that had sustained the bloodshed for so long was something known as Nakura's Hex.\\nNakura's Hex was a terrifying sorcery that sucked the life of all living things and the land itself dry, giving it unto powerful samurai and feeding the war effort.\\nAnd those who used such depraved magics to dominate the land were scoundrels known as the Nakura Daimyo.\\nThe Daimyo vied for dominance, but no matter who won, the earth would be further robbed of life.\\nThis was the true face of the war that had raged for nearly a century now.\\n\"And the ones who created the Hex are the Onmyouji who dwell in the Sky Tower at the center of the world.\"\\n\\nIgnoring Princess Mina, who had wavered at the sight before her eyes, the samurai continued faintly,\\n\"O 'princess who brings destruction'... Has this world not already been destroyed?\""
