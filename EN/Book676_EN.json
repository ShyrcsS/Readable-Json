Whenever I think of your paper's rhetoric, which intentionally passes off falsehoods as truth, I simply cannot suppress my indignation. As such, I have taken Sir Arthur captive.\\nI eagerly await your paper's sincere repentance. Issue a public apology and surrender Mosso's legacy.\\nShould you continue to spin a web of lies that obfuscates the truth, I will be left with no choice but to slay that Steambird.\\nCrow or Blackbird?"
