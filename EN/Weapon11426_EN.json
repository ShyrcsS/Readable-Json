Banding together with comrades active near Mont Automnequi, they occupied Poisson,\\nAnd seizing the members of the Maison Gardiennage charged with transporting them as hostages, they made a series of unreasonable demands.\\nThis incident was finally resolved by the active intervention of the Marechaussee Hunters.\\n\\nThe reporter who volunteered to deliver the negotiation demands, Karl Ingold, took this photo in Poisson before the situation deteriorated:\\nIn the middle of the picture stands Eduardo Baker, leaning on his famous — or infamous — bronze pipe like a cane.\\nEduardo's other hand is on his son Jakob's shoulder, who is nervously clutching the sleeve of Rene de Petrichor.\\nTo their left is the Great Magician Parsifal, casually leaning on the railing, flashing her signature stage smile.\\nTo Eduardo's right is the current mayor of Poisson, Renault de Petrichor. He dressed up quite formally for the occasion, though his collar is askew.\\nHis son Rene stands in front of him, attracted by a marvel such as this new Kamera, with eyes wide and somewhat at a loss.\\nThe woman to Parsifal's left holding an infant is Rosa Reed, with her husband Thompson, and on the far right of the picture is Tom Alter.\\nThey are looking ahead, their faces washed pale by the Kamera's bulb. They seem to be focused not on Ingold, nor on the Kamera.\\nBut on the future."
