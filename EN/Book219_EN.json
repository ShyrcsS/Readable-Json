    "Book219_EN.txt": "—Modest Fortune—\\nThe air pressure is a little low, which makes you think back far into your past.\\nMemories of your long-lost youth and friends with whom you have lost contact come to mind.\\nThey bring with them a touch of nostalgia, and a hint of sadness.\\nIt is good to remember the past once in a while. May it help you calm your mind and face the future.\\n\\nYour lucky object for the day: Fresh Mint\\nWherever there is vegetation, there is Mint.\\nIn this sense, Mint is the most resilient life-form in the world.\\nIt is said that it even grows amid the snow of Mondstadt's highest mountain."
