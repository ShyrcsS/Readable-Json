Wo-ho!\\nThese distant, far-off lands, the hometown of my grandparents,\\nThey were thrown down, destroyed by disaster and violence, like collapsing mountains and raging wildfires...\\nMy ancestors once lived in prosperity and peace, yet were plunged into famine and exile,\\nMy heart cries out for them, I mourn their tragic fate,\\nLike unquenchable flame roiling beneath spring waters, so profound a resentment, so deep a sorrow!\\nEver shall I wander along that never-ending wellspring of sighs,\\nAnd I shall come to fields of mottled green — that my ancestors called Kahotea.\\nAnd like the ancient dragons, soar effortlessly to the mountains where chants abound...\\nThe lost envoys of the heavens built there a city of gold and stone,\\nBut it was destroyed when raging flame fell from the heavens, the fury of the ancient sovereign.\\nWo-ho! Wo-ho!\\n\\nAnd so I wander on, to Poheka, the land of abundance,\\nThere Rangi Nui once stood upright between heaven and earth, so the ancestors say,\\nFor he was both a sage who spoke to the heavens, and a hero of the land,\\nWhose soul returned to the rising sun, whereupon the sky itself became Rangi Nui.\\nThen, I shall head from the land of abundance to the distant shore,\\nAnd on a shore overgrown with tendrils, conclude my final journey.\\n\\nI once climbed the lonely, desolate volcano,\\nI have seen countless hot springs with my own eyes,\\nAnd I shall head to the other side of the dark currents,\\nTo seek the ferryman, who rows a dugout canoe and wears a gold-feathered crown,\\nAnd when at last I see that circlet, glimmering in gold,\\nThen shall I again reunite with my kin in the garden of Hairinei,\\nThe birthplace of the forgotten sovereign of humans,\\nAnd I shall gather my tribespeople and friends, and we shall go there together."
