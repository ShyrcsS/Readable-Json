    "Book74_EN.txt": "Of all the elements in the land, Geo alone stands fast,\\nBuilt on a bedrock of proud tradition, which doth make it last.\\nFor just is the law of Rex Lapis, and ineffable His wisdom —\\nThe cornerstones of justice, which prevails throughout His kingdom.\\nSlayer of foul demons, no evil would He leave unquenched.\\n\\nHe sought celestial order, to stay the tide of turbulence.\\nAdepti rallied 'round Him, yaksha guardians charged ahead,\\nFrightened by the courageous people the demons fled.\\nThe Lord then fashioned mighty rocks, which into the earth He cast:\\nThe sea monster subdued, peace returned at last!\\n\\nThough demons lay defeated, their souls did plot revenge.\\nDown into the watery abyss the demonic souls did descend.\\nHatred fueled their rage. Rage, in turn, did blunt their mind,\\nTheir folly sullied the seas, whence the demons multiplied:\\nA demonic infestation thus engendered by the fallen souls.\\n\\nFive yaksha guardians His Majesty task'd with evil to defeat,\\nTo rid the world of poisonous rage with which the demons seethed.\\nMountains shook as yaksha wrath with golden splendor burned,\\nBut though they purged the evil, alas! One alone returned:\\nAlatus, by whose talons foes were quashed and peace procured.\\n\\nA peace that harked to days gone by was the peace that now endured.\\nPeace restored, adepti back to Jueyun Karst ascended.\\nDuty fulfilled, yakshas off to unknown corners departed.\\nMay this lowly offering departed souls appease.\\nAnd may these words by fire's light His Majesty's heart please."
