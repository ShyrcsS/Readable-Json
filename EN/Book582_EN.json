    "Book582_EN.txt": "I must make one thing clear first: I am not someone who would never lie.\\n\\nAfter hearing your question, I thought about many things in the past in earnest and recalled many occasions upon which I lied.\\n\\nI often make up excuses to avoid choir practice. I also tell white lies, too, sometimes to make myself happy, and other times, to allow myself to give up on some struggles.\\n\\nThe nicest lie I've ever come up with is the one I told Varka: That I didn't want to stay in Mondstadt. Varka responded with another lie — and that was his advice to me: \"Your current abilities are not suited to life beyond Mondstadt's borders.\"\\n\\nI can't be the answer to this question, but I suggest that you consider what \"never lying\" actually means.\\n\\nDoes it mean to never deceive, or to never lie with ill intent?\\n\\nIt's a pity that I'm not the one you're looking for, but I believe that someone who meets the requirements will turn up. Good luck.\\n\\n<right>Rosaria</right>"
