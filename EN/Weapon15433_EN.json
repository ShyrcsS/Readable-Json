The deception was so complete that no one even suspected his true identity as the noble Nashchokin.\\nHe was both a noble, enduring the tedium of court and aristocratic society, and the infamous thief who plundered the guarded treasures of the very lords he laughed and chatted with perhaps just moments before.\\nBy right, his life should have been a calm and measured one, untouched by the influence of any other. And yet...\\n\\n\"Hey! You sly fox — yes, I mean you. Always hiding in the shadows, huh? If you have the stones, come with me to the Grand Duke's dinner banquet!\"\\n\"Let's have a contest. Whoever uncovers the duke's secret first wins the mantle of the master thief!\"\\n\"And don't forget: if you lose, you have to give up the nobles' gold and silver to those who truly need it. That's the way of a true master thief.\"\\n\\nThe fae had meant to avoid all trouble, this included. That changed the moment he saw a young lady at the banquet sneering at the gathered worthies.\\nHer masterful disguise as a distinguished guest had one glaring flaw — her utter lack of pretense.\\nSo he accepted Bladebreaker's challenge, but not for the thrill of victory. All he wanted was to glimpse the true nature of a person, a thing so rarely revealed in this world.\\n\\nCleverer than beating the game was to never play it, and the fae who sidestepped said game always came out ahead.\\nFuming with humiliation, the young lady refused to concede defeat. This time, her challenge was a personal one: to strip the noble of his greatest honor.\\nShe stole the treasure gifted by the Tsaritsa herself, then gave it to the poor children. Surely, victory was at hand.\\nNot far off, the fae chuckled as he quietly returned the ragged children's toy to the gilded display case.\\nThe sight of the toy astonished both the young lady and the nobles at the unveiling ceremony, and it was clear who had won.\\n\\nOnly this time, the nobles had finally tired of the provocations of the base. And so, they had laid a trap from which there could be no escape.\\nTo the problem, the fae saw a simple solution — the thief who stole the treasure and the one who placed the toy inside need not be two people. So, he calmly stepped into the trap and took the blame for them both.\\n\\nHis influential family name spared him a public execution, and even secured him a final request.\\n\"Please prepare an empty coffin for my burial,\" the fae finally said after a period of silence. Surprisingly, his request was granted without hesitation.\\nA smile touched the fae's lips, and then he plunged from the high wall into the eternal silence, stealing the final judgment of life and death from the hands of the higher powers.\\nyet the thief known as the Vagabond could not ultimately escape the dark shadow of death.\\n\\nFew secrets last forever, save for those buried deep within the grave...\\n\"My dearest friend, I hope you never unravel this mystery in your lifetime.\""
