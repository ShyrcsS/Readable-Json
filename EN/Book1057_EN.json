This Zhaka guy's just an apprentice, he can't make anything good!\\nThe quality of these dolls is so poor, you can tell at a glance that they're fake. Do me a favor and find some pigs dumber than you, then get rid of these goods at a discount.\\nIf you can't handle even that, then scram like the pig you are."
