Not only are the sights amazing, but the animals there are super cute! I recommend going in the afternoon!\\n...\\n(Location that has been crossed out.)\\n...\\nThe Jademouth! A life lived without visiting it is surely one with regrets, especially that gemstone orb. When you look at it in the morning, it's like a moon that has yet to set.\\n...\\n(Location that has been crossed out.)\\n...\\nThe Lotus Pond next to the Ancient Teatree King may not be that famous, but I find it to have a serene beauty at night. You just have to be careful of the monsters nearby.\\n...\\n(Location that has been crossed out.)\\n...\\nIf you ask me, it's gotta be... Mt. Xuanlian, right? You rarely see such strange mountains anywhere else, and sunset there is truly moving.\\n...\\n(There are other locations written in the guide, but they've also been crossed out.)\\n\\n"
