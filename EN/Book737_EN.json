The paper is creased and the handwriting is sloppy, suggesting it was written in a state of extreme distress.)\\n(It was signed at the end with a fingerprint rather than a signature. Judging from the mark, however, it certainly doesn't appear to have been made with a gentle pigment, like that of an ink pad.)\\n"
