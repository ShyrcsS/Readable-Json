Kneeling before it, the Thundersoother plucked it with reverence.\\n\\nThe Thundersoother wore this flower on his chest at all times as he fearlessly faced the thunder and lightning.\\nEven when fighting the fierce Beast of Thunder, his resolve never wavered.\\nTo the Thundersoother, wearing this purple flower may have been merely an act of whimsy,\\nbut to travelers, the flower was the source of the unfaltering resolve that conquered the thunder.\\n"
