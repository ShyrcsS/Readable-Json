Love is fleeting, and even lasting memories may be lost.\"\\n\"Losing one's memory is no different from losing one's life. It is like death amidst darkness eternal.\"\\n\\nThis time, even a faint smile could not conceal her sorrow.\\nThough this is a festive day, it seems more like a farewell.\\n\\n\"Right, then. Why don't you tell me about the idiot Konbumaru?\"\\n\"What's wrong? Still afraid that an old hag like me will steal him from you?\""
