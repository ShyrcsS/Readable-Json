He crafted this hourglass to mark the passing of time.\\nAs the flames blazed, burning sand flowed endlessly through the hourglass day after day.\\n\\nSadly, though the Lavawalker did not fear the scorching flames of the Mare Jivari, he could not quench the torturing flames of time.\\nThe anguish of being left alone without the disciples and family he held so dear burned away at his soul more than any flames could ever scorch his flesh.\\n"
