Will he not then come forth?\"\\n(Danqing, andante calmo)\\nZixin: \"Thus is it said—\"\\nZixin: \"As wine turns red peoples' faces, so do riches move many places.\"\\n(Zixin lowers her head and paces)\\nZixin: \"I am of a mind to find him with this device, yet I wonder if he should come forthwith.\"\\n(Aside)\\nGrandma Zhang: \"Come now, do not hesitate. Let us take action.\"\\nGrandma Zhang: \"You shall lose little who rely on me.\"\\n(Exeunt Zixin and Grandma Zhang)\\n\\nScene II\\n(Enter Zhang San, Li Si, Wang Er'ma)\\n(Sprechstimme)\\nZhang San: \"I am Zhang San.\"\\nLi Si: \"I, Li Si.\"\\nWang Er'ma: \"And Wang Er'ma I.\"\\nZhang San: \"Hark at that notice! Let me go up, and earn the bounty.\"\\nLi Si: \"Shall the officer ask, 'think to do good, do you?'\"\\nWang Er'ma: \"Hah! A fool is he who would speak true.\"\\n(Aside)\\nZhang San: \"Ho, brothers. Are you all bound for that lass Zixin's place, her reward to claim?\"\\nLi Si: \"Indeed.\"\\nWang Er'ma: \"So it is.\"\\nLi Si: \"Picked up her headdress also, did you?\"\\nWang Er'ma: \"No, I'd have sworn it was her earrings.\"\\nLi Si: \"Falsehood - t'was the flower upon her head.\"\\nZhang San: \"Fools. Perfume it was!\"\\nWang Er'ma: \"Ah, however it may be, sure am I that we all know well the score.\"\\nZhang San: \"Ahahah.\"\\nLi Si: \"Haha!\"\\n(Zhang San, Li Si, and Wang Er'ma turn to Zixin)\\nZhang San: \"Ah, Zixin, have you my bounty ready? For I, Zhang San, have found your lost perfume!\"\\nLi Si: \"Stand aside, friend, for I have come to return your headdress. The prize is mine, therefore.\"\\nWang Er'ma: \"No, no, no, Wang Er'ma it is who returns your earrings. Mine is the reward.\"\\nZixin: \"You... you lot dizzy me.\"\\nZixin: \"For we have never met, and if I lost my earrings, scents, or headwear, would I not know it?\"\\nZhang San: \"Why, you must have forgotten it in your hurry at the fish-store. Just give the reward here, do not worry!\"\\nLi Si: \"The Mora, then, and be quick about it!\"\\nWang Er'ma: \"Or I shall ruin your stall, and your good name.\"\\nZixin: \"Ah... How I have attracted the eye of these worthless scoundrels!\"\\nZixin: \"Granny, see what trouble your plan has wrought!\"\\nGrandma Zhang: \"Worry not, lass. I shall devise a way to see them off.\"\\nGrandma Zhang: \"Hah!\"\\n(Zhang San, Li Si, Wang Er'ma fall to the ground)\\nGrandma Zhang: \"I had this lass put up a false bounty to catch such thieves as you!\"\\nGrandma Zhang: \"The items you bring are false — now hand them over.\"\\nGrandma Zhang: \"Or else...\"\\nZhang San: \"Or else what?\"\\nGrandma Zhang: \"Then the headdress made of prize Glaze Lilies, the earrings of fine Noctilucous Jade, and the scents shipped in from a faraway land...\\nGrandma Zhang: \"You shall have to pay for them all! Now then, where is the Mora? Give it here!\"\\n(Grandma Zhang pursues Zhang San, Li Si, Wang Er'ma, broom in hand)\\nZhang San: \"Ow, ow!\"\\nLi Si: \"Stop hitting us, please! We don't want your Mora anymore!\"\\nWang Er'ma: \"Now to find that fellow who truly picked her things up to come and own up — sooner rather than late!\"\\n\\nScene III\\n(Zhang San brings Fan Jie in)\\n(Aside)\\nZhang San: \"Why, I have it now. You must be the thief who took the lady's things. My brothers and I took a beating on your account!\"\\nFan Jie: \"I, Fan Jie, have ever been upright, and such things as stealing are beneath me. Do not think to accuse me falsely.\"\\nZhang San: \"Well, aren't you a stubborn one? Dare you go up with me to meet the owner of the lost goods?\"\\nFan Jie: \"I fear you not. Let us go! Indeed, I should like to see who it is who maligns me.\"\\n(Zhang San and Fan Jie turn to Zixin)\\nZhang San: \"Is the proprietor not Zixin? I shall see how you get out of this one!\"\\nFan Jie: \"Ah! So it is you, then!\"\\n(Dongtang, appassionato)\\nFan Jie: \"This was the lady who was wroth, and no more words came from her mouth.\"\\n(Dongtang, allegro)\\nFan Jie: \"Cease deceiving the young woman, for I am Fan Jie, a dock worker.\"\\nFan Jie: \"I have lived frugally and humbly. Whereupon would I steal a lady's makeup?\"\\nFan Jie: \"You met my honesty with accusations, though I returned the item swiftly as I could.\"\\n(Aside)\\nZixin: \"Ah, so this hero is named Fan Jie.\"\\nZixin: \"It is my fault, then, that he should have been tangled up in this business.\"\\nZixin: \"I shall beg his forgiveness shortly — and should he not accept, twice or thrice more shall not be too few.\"\\n(Zixin walks up to apologize to Fan Jie)\\nZixin: \"O, hero, indeed we had a misunderstanding before, but...\"\\n(Fan Jie turns)\\nFan Jie: \"Hmph.\"\\n(Zixin smiles and steps forward)\\nZixin: \"...I did have some other motive in doing this.\"\\nZixin: \"For you did not leave your name behind when you left, and I wished to repay you but found you not.\"\\nZixin: \"So I decided on this device. It is my fault that such trouble came to you.\"\\nZixin: \"Please, allow me to apologize.\"\\nFan Jie: \"Oh?\"\\n(Dongtang, lento, innig)\\nFan Jie: \"Though I was at first resentful to be maligned, when I calm down to think, I realize it was but a misunderstanding.\"\\nFan Jie: \"Calm must rule me, lest I speak in error.\"\\n(Aside)\\nFan Jie: \"If I may ask you...\"\\nFan Jie: \"You said earlier that the business from before was a misunderstanding.\"\\nFan Jie: \"You were of a mind to seek the person who returned your string of pearls, and put out that notice, which by chance snared me wrongly, is that true?\"\\nZixin: \"It is, and again, I apologize.\"\\n(Fan Jie catches Zixin)\\nFan Jie: \"Nay, you need not be so polite. You do me too much honor.\"\\nFan Jie: \"I, too, acted rashly, and put you upon the spot. I, too, must apologize.\"\\nZixin: \"Oh, no, please...\"\\n(Fan Jie salutes her)\\nZhang San: \"What!? What are you doing? So is the Mora to be paid or not?\"\\nGrandma Zhang: \"Oh, shush you. This is their tale — what business is it of yours?\"\\nGrandma Zhang: \"See, all the ladies and gentlemen in the audience are here to see a show by Yun Jin, and they have no time for your nonsense.\"\\nGrandma Zhang: \"Open your eyes and see, and stand aside there.\"\\n(Exeunt, Grandma Zhang dragging Zhang San)\\nZixin: \"Come to think of it, I sell fish here every day. How is it, then, that I have never seen you?\"\\nFan Jie: \"I pass this way each day to work.\"\\nFan Jie: \"Perhaps I was lost amid the throng. But perchance we may meet tomorrow...\"\\nZixin: \"So it is... May we meet then.\""
