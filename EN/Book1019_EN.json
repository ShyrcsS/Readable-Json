    "Book1019_EN.txt": "Sundjatta, who had lost his good name by voluntarily embarking on an adventurous journey,\\nHeaded to the distant lava lake, letting the scorching waves burn his body.\\nThis burning lake has now cooled, and dragons play havoc there no more,\\nBut in those days, it was the abode ruled by the evil dragon Lukwata,\\nOne of the few survivors of the ancient dragon race,\\nWho, with malice in its heart, sought ever to restore ancient draconic tyranny.\\nThe ancient war, which had rocked both heaven and earth, had destroyed its tribe,\\nBut it hid in a dark, rocky cave, thus evading utter devastation.\\n\\nWithout servants to wait upon it, Lukwata had grown decrepit,\\nEyes scorched blind by sulfur's breath, mind becoming dull and frenzied.\\nInextricably trapped in a delirious dream of battle against heavenly envoys, clinging to life,\\nUnaware of the human epoch that had come upon Natlan.\\nSo when a tiny slave came to its hideout and issued a challenge,\\nThe ancient dragon arose in fury, coughing and retching, hurling curses unceasingly,\\nAlong with which spewed flames and sulfur from its maw,\\n\"You insolent wretch! You dare disturb my royal slumber!?\"\\n\\nSundjatta saw that the vile dragon of legend had long become doddering and deranged,\\nThat it would claim a Sovereign's title while forgetting its race.\\nSo he burst into laughter, hoisting his massive hammer, and mocked the enfeebled drake:\\n\"I am merely a nameless miner, not some contemptible knave.\"\\n\"Just as you are no king — merely a tottering lizard!\"\\nRage surged in Lukwata's throat upon hearing these words, and with more wild retching,\\nIt spat forth filthy, scorching lava, billowing forth plumes of pitch-black smoke,\\nAt which Sundjatta did not even frown, instead swinging his heavy hammer down on the old drake.\\n\\nOld and infirm was Lukwata, yet when enraged it remained terrifyingly formidable,\\nAnd as the great heat of the magma scorched Sundjatta's hair and eyebrows,\\nThe dragon's fierce venom again seeped into flesh and viscera, the unbearable agony burning deep,\\nAnd its massive yellowed fangs left festering wounds, while sharpened claws tore open old scars.\\nYet on and on Sundjatta swung, enduring tremendous pain,\\nUntil the dragon's craggy head split open, until the hammer-storm blew the black smog away.\\nAnd when the elder dragon's soul had been scattered to the winds, and the magma lake had cooled by half,\\nSundjatta lay down, contented — truly now did he deserve a hero's name!"
