The time it tells is still accurate.\\nPunctuality is a virtue, and this pocket watch helped the nobles stay on a virtuous path.\\nIt was more for self-discipline than a tool to influence the common folk.\\nAt daybreak, a worthy noble must be more vigilant than his people.\\nAt night, he should be more thoughtful and restless than they.\\n\\nOver the years, the once-strict schedule was overturned by their indolent descendants.\\nTheir timepieces grew more extravagant, but lost their virtuous function.\\n"
