You may encounter an unpleasant situation.\\nYou will still be waiting for the commendation you are due, and you may be served the wrong dish by the waiting staff.\\nNothing terrible happens, but everything seems to irritate you.\\nIt's just one of those days.\\n\\nYour lucky object for the day: Drifting Seagrass\\nSeagrass is a gentle but tenacious plant.\\nDespite the bitterness of the seawater around it, it refuses to change.\\nHold onto your gentle nature, even when nothing is going your way."
