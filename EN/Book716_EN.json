The drive valve can be used to rotate, open, and close the connecting paths for each area.\\n2. The drive valve is controlled via both the Core Gear Drive (non-removable) and the <color=#00E1FFFF>Gear Drivetrain (removable)</color>.\\n3. The non-removable Core Gear Drive controls the central room, while the Gear Drivetrain controls the direction of each connecting path.\\n4. When operating, take note that <color=#00E1FFFF>when the direction indicated by the Core Gear Drive is opposite to that indicated by the Gear Drivetrain, the path indicated by the Core Gear Drive will be opened</color>.\\n5. When all 4 Gear Drivetrains are uninstalled, the drive valve will automatically terminate operation.\\n\\nThe display indications for opening each connecting path are as follows:\\n\\n<center><color=#00E1FFFF>To Supply Warehouse 1</color></center>\\n<image name=UI_FontaineTutorial_RotationDevice_01 />\\n\\n<center><color=#00E1FFFF>To the Geode Mine Shaft</color></center>\\n<image name=UI_FontaineTutorial_RotationDevice_04 />\\n\\n<center><color=#00E1FFFF>To Energy Storage Warehouse</color></center>\\n<image name=UI_FontaineTutorial_RotationDevice_05 />\\n\\n<center><color=#00E1FFFF>To Supply Warehouse 2</color></center>\\n<image name=UI_FontaineTutorial_RotationDevice_03 />\\n\\nAdditionally, a new locking device has been deployed in the Geode Mine Shaft.
