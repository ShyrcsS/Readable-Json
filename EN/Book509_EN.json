    "Book509_EN.txt": "Podporuchik Yurochka:\\nI believe you have read the mission report.\\nElchingen's plan is in contrast to the style of our regular forces. He should have the sense that acting without orders from superiors would result in trouble for the entire organization.\\nIt is certain that he wants to win the recognition from his superiors by taking risks to secure achievements.\\nBefore the Lord Harbingers give us any new orders, Elchingen's actions may well lead my division into peril. Thus it is necessary to eliminate this risk before it causes any further damage to the situation.\\nI have tried my best to look for a window of opportunity. The Akademiya will handle Elchingen with caution by transferring him and relevant evidence to the prison near the location mentioned in this report. Knowing Elchingen, he will undoubtedly manage to escape during the transfer and seek refuge from other Fatui divisions.\\nPresently, your battle position is most suitable. You will be the one carrying out this mission.\\nSend out rendezvous signals, disguised as help, and give him a pleasant surprise. Then check around, find his minions, and deal with them for good."
